         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have real ≈øomewhere of an <hi>Hermite,</hi> who being guided by an Angel unto two Cities, ≈øaw the Gates of the fir≈øt clo≈øe ≈øhut, and a Devil having the Keys there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at his Girdle in a deep ≈øleep, and ≈ønort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, From thence he is led unto the other, (which was fair and ≈øpacious,) and finds the Gates wide open, innumerable Devils crouding and thronging in, multitudes climbing over the walls, and whole ≈øwarms of them in the Churches, Streets, Hou≈øes, Shops, walks, and all other Avenues
<pb facs="tcp:96502:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>and places of concour≈øe, exceedingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, bu≈øying and be≈øtirring them≈øelves to the utmo≈øt for the ruine of it, and her Inhabitants. At which wondring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mea≈øure, the Angel told him, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der City is the wor≈øt of the Two, ingulpht in all wickedne≈øs and irreligion, ≈øo that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> hath no fear of loo≈øing it, and therefore there is but one Devil to guard it, and his work ≈øo little, that he ≈øleeps. But as for this wherein now we are, here are many Souls fearing and ≈øerving God, Religion is profe≈ø≈øed, and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip countenanced and incouraged, and the Holy Angels of God are watching over the≈øe precious Saints and their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to pre≈øerve them. This hath cau≈øed Hell to break loo≈øe, and to endeavor by all means, and arts imaginable their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and its de≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>Sirs, I think this be no unfitting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of our <hi>Plymouth,</hi> wherein I tru≈øt there are multitudes of Gods dear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as well as Sinners: But I fear me, multitude of Devils al≈øo, that walk in
<pb facs="tcp:96502:3"/>Temples and Congregations, in Streets and Hou≈øes, in Chambers and Clo≈øets, in Ships and Shops, upon Keys and Exchange. The over abounding of Sin among us, and of late of that hainous and crying ≈øin of Blood and Murther, (for which Two of the prime Actors (and God knows whether there be any other) have ≈øuffered condign puni≈øhment,) is too ≈øad and clear an in≈øtance hereof. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> was at the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was more than time for the Con≈øuls and Senate to look about them. Woe! Woe! Unto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth, ≈øaith an Angel from Heaven, Becau≈øe the Devil is come down among you, having great wrath, for his time is ≈øhort. He doth not appear in a vi≈øible ≈øhape at noon day, but walks (as his younger Son the <hi>Je≈øuite</hi>) in all ≈øorts of Ma≈øques and di≈øgui≈øes, in every habit and fa≈øhion, and among Per≈øons of every Trade, Calling, Quality, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Now, Sirs, God having con≈øtituted you the <hi>Angel-Guardians</hi> of our <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96502:4"/>and made you Gods unto it, there is all rea≈øon you ≈øhould be awake, and do your utmo≈øt to prevent the Stratagems and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Hell again≈øt it. I know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way or means that you have, than by an exemplary Holine≈øs in your lives, than by walking with God in your re≈øpective Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Callings, than by a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, zealous, activity for God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, and a vigorous ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial puni≈øhing of all Vice and Impiety. Would you but continue your great re≈øpects and incouragements to your Reverend and Learned Mini≈øters, and joyn both Swords together, Temporal and Spiritual, I am confident the de≈øigns of Hell again≈øt you would be broken, fru≈øtrated, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Honored Sirs, My hearts de≈øire and Prayer for you is, that you may do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in your <hi>Ephrata,</hi> and Famou≈øly in your <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that you may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in your Station, and that God may reflect rays and beams of Glory upon you, <hi>For ≈øuch as Honor him, God
<pb facs="tcp:96502:4"/>will Honor them, but they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øe him ≈øhall be lightly e≈øteemed, 1 Sam. 2.30.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs, if you will ≈øuppre≈øs all prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and by your Authority put out the Fire of uncleanne≈øs, if you will ≈øtop the Mouth, and Gag the Tongue of the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that the Roaring of Oaths and Cur≈øes be not heard in our Streets, if you will promote true practical Piety, and per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere as you have begun in the con≈øcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous di≈øcharge of your Magi≈øtratical Duty, the God of ble≈ø≈øings will ble≈øs your per≈øons and Families, and <hi>Plymouth</hi> ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a <hi>Sodom</hi> but <hi>Zion,</hi> ≈øhall ever be a, <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> for Go≈øpel-priviledges, a Pillar and Ground of Truth, rich and flouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Tyre</hi> for Trade and Traffick, and as formerly, ≈øo in after-times a <hi>Zoar</hi> for Divine ≈øafety and wonderful pre≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>That endeared affection I have for the Town of my Nativity, where I fir≈øt drew my breath, and where I had my School-Education, moveth me to ≈øpeak
<pb facs="tcp:96502:5"/>and write ≈øo freely. And your true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs cannot but make a candid interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
            <p>May <hi>Plymouth,</hi> her Magistrates and Government ever live before God! May this Famous Town be called <hi>Hephzibah</hi> and <hi>Beulah,</hi> the <hi>Delight of God, and Married</hi> unto God! Let her be called the Righteous, the Holy City!

            <p>Our fir≈øt Parents a Compendium of both Worlds, Sublunary and Aetherial, the Crown of Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>but a little lower than the Angels,</hi> are become the objects of his rage and fury. Satan had lo≈øt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he envies them Earth. Their habitation in an Earthly Heaven di≈øplea≈øeth him, becau≈øe it plea≈øeth God. They ju≈øt now came out of their <hi>Creators hands</hi> endowed with a double Portion, Holyne≈øs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs: But he re≈øolves they ≈øhall not long enjoy either. Hence in the very fir≈øt <hi>dawn</hi> of their Creation, he contrived and accompli≈øhed their de≈øtruction. He ≈øubtilly in≈øinuates the poy≈øon of ≈øin by his conferences with, and ≈øugge≈øtions unto <hi>Eve,</hi> and ≈øhe having once ta≈øted of the do≈øe, and allured with the deceitful plea≈øantne≈øs thereof to her ≈øen≈øual appetite, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates it to her Husband, and they both derive it down unto all their natural po≈øterity.</p>
            <p>Ah! How many Murders were in this One? Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind made and ruined altogether. Certainly they who plotted the blowing up of King and Kingdom in One hour, they who effected the <hi>Sicilian Ve≈øpers,
<pb facs="tcp:96502:6"/>Pari≈øian Mattins, and Iri≈øh Ma≈ø≈øacres</hi> had been all trained up and Educated in the Schools of this, this old, and Grand <hi>Abaddon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> being in Honor, continued not a day in it. His glorious ≈øtate did ≈øhine, and ≈øet with the ≈øame Sun. In the Morning it flouri≈øhed and grew up, in the Evening it was cut down and withered like the Gra≈øs. He played away (as a be≈øorted Game≈øter) his whole, and all pre≈øent and to come, what he had in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, what he might have in Rever≈øion, at one ca≈øt. Nothing was left him but his ≈øin and cur≈øe, and this he propagates unto all his Children. (A mo≈øt ≈øad Portion) to be inherited by us.</p>
            <p>Sin being now conceived doth prodigiou≈øly ≈øpawa and ≈øwarm. The Old Serpent is not idle. His boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malice gives him no re≈øt. His fir≈øt born like the Plague ≈øpreads its venom univer≈øally, and new Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters are hatched and produced by it every day. New ≈øins in new ≈øhapes, in odious and hideous colours ≈øhew forth their heads. Grace is mode≈øt. Sin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and ≈øhamele≈øs: It ≈øeeketh no di≈øgui≈øe, nor putteth on a Vizard, but for its own ≈øecurity, and in order to further mi≈øchief, to perpetrate ≈øome greater Villany.</p>
            <p>The Devil having ≈øet variance between God and Man, will give another ca≈øt of his Office: He throws a Bone of contention between Man and Man. The neare≈øt Relations, the deare≈øt Friends, they that had the ≈øame fle≈øh in their Bodies, the ≈øame blood in their veins, that if not Twins yet ≈øcarce divided in their age, that were Nur≈øt, Fed, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated together, both alike tendered by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent and Religious Parents, ≈øhall yet through his ≈øubtilty and cruelty be ≈øundered and divided one from the other: And if he cannot drag them both with him≈øelf into Hell, yet will he precipitate
<pb facs="tcp:96502:6"/>the one by a bloody and Barbarous death into his untimely Grave, and the other (by a ≈øin like his own) into the bottomle≈øs Pit of de≈øtruction ere he is aware of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cain</hi> by the in≈øtigation of the wicked one, upon no provocation, no offence given, (unle≈øs Gods gracious acceptance of <hi>Abel</hi> for his Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs be a crime,) Murthers his own, his only and deare≈øt Brother. Bloody Villain! Thou choppe≈øt off thy right hand with thy left, thou da≈øhe≈øt out thine own Brains in da≈øhing out his. Thou de≈øtroye≈øt his, body, but damne≈øt thine own Soul. Ah, what grief it this to Pious <hi>Adam!</hi> Oh, what joy and Mu≈øick unto Hell! Revenge is ≈øweet. But its a poor revenge, Satan! Which ends hi thine own, in thine endle≈øs de≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>However the Devil hath ≈øhown the way of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, and bad Arts are ≈øoon learnt. Any one may be an ea≈øie and early proficient in Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, the whole and old World ≈øoon got the skill of it. God ≈øaw that the wickedne≈øs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. The Earth al≈øo was corrupt before God, and filled with Violence: All fle≈øh had perverted its way, and blood touched blood.</p>
            <p>There was no fair and gentle means left une≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øayed by God to reclaim ≈øinners, to dam up, if po≈ø≈øible, the torrents of their ungodline≈øs, to ≈øtench tho≈øe foul i≈ø≈øues, and frequent effu≈øions of Innocent blood. <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Holy Patriarks decry it down in their Lives and Sermons. <hi>Enoch</hi> (the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of his Age for the life and power of Godline≈øs ≈øhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mo≈øt illu≈øtriou≈øly in his Conver≈øation) Thunders out Prophe≈øies of dreadful Judgments again≈øt the irreligious <hi>Cainites. Behold,</hi> ≈øaith that Glorious
<pb facs="tcp:96502:7"/>Saint, <hi>The Lord cometh with Holy Myriads of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to Execute vengeance upon all the ungodly, and to convince you of your ungodline≈øs in flames of Fire, who will not be convinced by our Mini≈øtry. Upon the wicked he ≈øhall Rain Snares, Fire, and Brim≈øtone, and an horrible Tempe≈øt, This ≈øhall be the Portion of their Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Prophet is counted a Fool, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man Mad, and his Menaces of approaching wrath idle Dreams, melancholly thoughts, bugbears to fright Children, and bublings up of his envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice again≈øt them. Thus he and his Prophecies are de≈øpi≈øed, and ≈øcornfully rejected.</p>
            <p>At la≈øt fair warning and loud calls and Summons unto Repentance having been long afforded them, and not accepted, nor in the lea≈øt improved, the patience of God is tired, mercy finally departs from them, and Divine Ju≈øtice ≈øweeps away the Habitations and per≈øons of tho≈øe Scarlet Sinners with a deluge of Waters.</p>
            <p>One would have thought that ≈øuch a fearful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øhould have cautioned afterages from ever tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ≈øteps. But alas! Po≈øterity is grown ≈øtupid, and Judgment-proof. As for Gods Judgments the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed makes a puff at them, they are afar off, above, and out of his ≈øight, he forgets and makes no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor account of them. God hath Hanged up ≈øome in Chains before their eyes, Executed a whole World of Malefactors, and made them an everla≈øting <hi>Sign and Example</hi> to them, yet they willfully ≈øhut their eyes that they may not ≈øee, and lock up the Doors of their hearts, that they may not con≈øider for what cau≈øes this great wrath is come upon them. So that we need not wonder at Gods plaguing ≈øuch willful blind Souls. It is but a righteous Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his Ju≈øtice oweth them. In as much as they
<pb facs="tcp:96502:7"/>regarded not the works of the Lord, nor took notice of the operation of his hand, he could not build them up, he mu≈øt totally and utterly de≈øtroy them. Sinners ate the Voluntary Carvers of their own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. They choo≈øe and Create unto them≈øelves their own bane and de≈øtruction, Temporal and Eternal. The reading of this en≈øuing Narrative will be a clear proof and evidence hereof.</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE.</head>
            <p>ON Munday the <hi>23</hi> day of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> la≈øt, <hi>1675. Elizabeth,</hi> the Wife of Mr. <hi>William Weeks</hi> of <hi>Plymouth Dyer,</hi> after many and frequent Vomitings and violent Purgations, departed this life towards the Evening. Her Husband and Daughter were ≈øeized with the ≈øame extraordinary motions, accompanied with griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pains and Swellings in their Stomacks, with cold Sweats and Faintings, as al≈øo with a great and unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Drought.</p>
            <p>A Phy≈øitian being called, and con≈øulted with upon the ca≈øe, giveth in his Judgment that they were Poy≈øoned. That which induced him the more readily to determine of the nature and manner of their Sickne≈øs, and her death, was a quantity of <hi>Crude Ar≈øenick,</hi> pre≈øented him by a Neighbor of the≈øe Afflicted and Murthered Per≈øons, which ≈øhe had found in a Pot of Oatmeal in the Kitchin.</p>
            <p>At the ≈øame time the Child of Mi≈øtris <hi>Pengelley</hi> (Daughter unto the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Weeks</hi>) was al≈øo affected with the ≈øame Symptoms, and <hi>Philip Cary</hi> her Nur≈øe, together with her Husband, were found Counterfeiting Sickne≈øs and Vomitings. Wine and Oyl had been given them, which procured a more ea≈øie relaxation and di≈øcharge of their Stomacks, and through the Ble≈ø≈øing of God, upon the u≈øe of that and other means contributed, to the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Child and his Grand-Father. Only his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mi≈øtris <hi>Pengelley,</hi> having labored Eight or Ten days under exqui≈øite torments without any remi≈ø≈øion, (Phy≈øick, and Phy≈øitians being di≈øabled by Gods Holy wi≈øe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, from affording her any relief or ≈øuccor,) ≈øhe al≈øo yielded up the Gho≈øt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96502:9"/>
            <p>The noi≈øe of this horrid Accident was ≈øoon ≈øpread abroad, and immediately the Nur≈øe and her Husband, and a Prentice Girle in the Hou≈øe were ≈øu≈øpected, and apprehended for it.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt which was brought before the Major of the Town, was <hi>Anne Evans</hi> Apprentice to the ≈øaid Mi≈øtris <hi>Weeks,</hi> a Poor Child, who≈øe Mother being dead, had been bound out in the Majoralty of Mr. <hi>Peter Schaggel,</hi> Anno <hi>1672.</hi> by the Church-Wardens and Over-Seers of <hi>Charles</hi> Pari≈øh, being then about Twelve or Thirteen years old.</p>
            <p>And now making her appearance, ≈øhe was examined by him, and another Ju≈øtice of his Maje≈øties Peace; which for the ≈øatisfaction of my Readers curio≈øity, and for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther di≈øcovery of this Crying and Helli≈øh ≈øin, I ≈øhall crave his pardon, if he be troubled with an Authentick Relation thereof, and of the other per≈øons depo≈øitions concerning it, as they were tran≈øcribed from the day Book of the Town.</p>

            <p>In truth they came thither the Slaves and Va≈ø≈øals of the Devil, full of Ignorance, and unacquainted with God, and the things of God, they were got into a Pri≈øon, <hi>the very Suburbs of Hell,</hi> a place (to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators

Indeed they might and ought to have done it. But they were captivated by the Prince of Darkne≈øs, who had blinded the eyes of their under≈øtandings, and Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hearts as with an hot Iron, that they ≈øhould not ≈øee, nor know, nor con≈øider the things that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto their Peace. Be≈øides they were held in ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Chains than tho≈øe of Iron; their own iniquities had taken hold of them, and they were bound with the Cords of their ≈øins.</p>
            <p>Here they fed them≈øelves, and are flattered al≈øo by their Companions in Ungodline≈øs, with the fond and fal≈øe hopes of e≈øcaping the Ju≈øtice of man; and as for that of God, they never Dream of it, it enters not into their thoughts. Let them but e≈øcape the Gallows and get out of Goal, they imagine Hell may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with le≈øs difficulty, and Heaven obtained with far more facility.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Camelion-like</hi> they live upon the Air, or with <hi>Ephraim</hi> upon the Ea≈øt wind; or as <hi>E≈øay's</hi> Idolator they feed upon A≈øhes; a deceived heart hath turned them a≈øide, that they cannot deliver their Souls, nor ≈øay, is there not a lie in our right hands? But in the depth of their Sencele≈øne≈øs and Security, they are ≈øurprized with a cold damp.</p>
            <p>The A≈ø≈øizes are come, the Judges arrived, the Trumpets ≈øound, and our wretched Pri≈øoners are Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned unto Judgment. Up they go unto the Bar with heavy hearts, though with undejected Countenances. They had ≈øome Figleave excu≈øes to cover their ≈øhame,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96502:20"/>and rather than want a Shift and Plea for them≈øelves, they will add ≈øin to ≈øin, lyings and impudent denials. Alas!

You Cloath your ≈øelves with a Net, your Nakedne≈øs and filth is the more Apparent. Witne≈ø≈øes are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, evidence is produced, the Malefactors are heard and permitted to ≈øpeak for them≈øelves, the Bill was found, and an Impartial Jury declares them Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are ca≈øt, Sentence is pronounced, and now being dead in Law, they Petition for a Tran≈øportation.</p>
            <p>Here is the la≈øt Refuge of mi≈øerable Murderers; But Ju≈øtice di≈øpen≈øeth no favors, they may be Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to another world, not to another Land.

Some will pitty me, though none will believe me, none can help me. Yet though ≈øhe mu≈øt die, as ≈øure as ≈øhe was born, the Devil helps her to one Expedient, as ≈øhe conceives that may ≈øave her Life. My Lord, I am Innocent, I am with Child, do not kill two Innocents. If I mu≈øt die, let my Child live!</p>
            <p>The Reverend Judge is too Righteous to puni≈øh the Innocent with the Guilty; or to de≈øtroy the Child for the Mothers fault. Hence a Midwife is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to attend the Court, a Jury of Matrons impannell'd, the Murdere≈øs is ≈øearched, and after their ≈øtricte≈øt Scrutiny and Inque≈øt, they find her a Lyar, to have troubled the Court needle≈øly, ≈øhe is not quick, as ≈øhe would bear them in hand, if ≈øhe have at all conceived.</p>
            <p>Upon this they are returned to their Pri≈øons, and now in ≈øight of Hell. Others pitty them, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at their di≈ømal State; but poor wretches, they have no Bowels for them≈øelves, yea, without any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sentiments, without any feeling apprehen≈øions of their approaching mi≈øery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plymouth</hi> hath been the fir≈øt Scene of this Tragedy, there had they committed their Murders, and upon the humble Petition of Ma≈øter <hi>Weeks,</hi> Husband, and Father to the Murdered Per≈øons, and concurrent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96502:21"/>of the Grand Jury, His Lord≈øhip grants it to be the place of their Execution. This was a rare Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ≈øuch a ≈øight was never ≈øeen ≈øince the foundations of that Town. Oh! that it might be the la≈øt.</p>
            <p>In the Interval of their Sentence and Execution, ≈øeveral Divines vi≈øit them.</p>
            <p>The Right Reverend Dioce≈øan, out of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care of their happine≈øs, ordered two, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attended on them, but with no ≈øucce≈øs on the Nur≈øes part. Other Mini≈øters moved by Charity, and yearning at their mi≈øery, did concur to u≈øe their utmo≈øt endeavors to ≈øave them from Hell. In≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Exhortations, Prayers, Tears, dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of un≈øu≈øterable torments with the damned, ≈øweet and gratious promi≈øes in ca≈øe of Confe≈ø≈øion, Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus are u≈øed and urged with the greate≈øt Vehemency, and indu≈øtry upon the Nur≈øe; but they beat the Air, they Plow the Rock, they do her no good, their labor of love is lo≈øt, their Prayers return into their own bo≈øoms.</p>
            <p>The Relator having vi≈øited them ≈øeveral times while they were in the High Goal at <hi>Exon,</hi> thought it convenient to ≈øubjoyn the ≈øub≈øtance and effect of his conferences with them. Po≈ø≈øibly it may not be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øing unto his Reader. Coming into the Pri≈øon early in the Morning, he had the Four condemned Per≈øons brought unto him; and be≈øpeaks them in the≈øe words, <hi>Mi≈øcrable Souls!</hi> I am heartily ≈øorty to ≈øee you in this place, and to find you in this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You are here Judged of man, and you mu≈øt die; but what al≈øo if you are Condemned of God, and mu≈øt to Hell for ever? You are Sinners, are you not? You are Guilty of tho≈øe Crimes for which Sentence is pa≈øt upon you? Three had ≈øo much Ingenuity as with Weeping and Trembling to acknowledge it.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96502:21"/>Alas! Poor wretches, you are weeping becau≈øe you have offended man, and brought your ≈øelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction.

            <p>What think you of Sin? Is it as ≈øweet and plea≈øing to you now you mu≈øt die for it, as when at fir≈øt you did commit it? <hi>Here they were ≈øilent and Confounded.</hi> Ah! Now you ≈øee what it is, not to believe God ≈øpeaking to you from his Word, and by his Mini≈øters, you were told that ≈øin would bring ≈øorrow and ≈øhame, wrath and death, ≈øooner or later. The Devil and your own corrupted heart, ro≈øe up again≈øt this Di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his will, and you made light and ≈ølight of it, and what have you got by it ? All the Fruit of your ≈øin is, that you are a≈øhamed of it, and grieved for it; its wages is the lo≈øs of Earth, Life, and Heaven, and the≈øe you are expecting every moment.

At this they ≈øhrugd up their ≈øhoulders, and had nothing to an≈øwer, but their Repentance. Your Repentance, ≈øaid I, what is that? <hi>Why, our

I know nothing to the contrary but that you would be Guilty of the ≈øame tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, of as bad, or wor≈øe.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, ≈øuppo≈øe your Repentance were true and real, what amends is that unto God for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold di≈øhonors you have done him? You have broken every command of God, you are Guilty of innumerable ≈øins, your very birth and nature is horribly corrupted, and all your life long you have been Rebels again≈øt God, and you think to put off Gods wrath with your pittiful Repentance, a late Repentance, and it may be no other than the very Reprobates have that are now in Hell.</p>
            <p>Is this all the ≈øatisfaction you can make to God? <hi>They knew no other;</hi> Then it was told them, that God was a great and terrible God, that would not put up the affronts and wrongs had been done him, without ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that he would by no means acquit the Guilty. That they had ≈øinned, and mu≈øt die eternally, and if ever they were redeemed from Eternal wrath, they mu≈øt make God full a mends, and bring him a Ran≈øome; and if they had none, nor knew where it was to be had, they mu≈øt expect as ≈øoon as they died, to be damned for ever.</p>
            <p>I asked of them in particular, who or what Je≈øus Chri≈øt was, and what it was he had done for them. To which there was this an≈øwer made, <hi>they could not tell.</hi> None that knows a Goal will conceive this a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hardly any but <hi>Athei≈øts,</hi> and the mo≈øt ignorant wretches in the whole County are clapt up there; and for one ≈øin they brought with them into it, they carry away Cart-loads out of it. Our County Pri≈øons being the Common Sinks of the Country, and a Shop
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96502:22"/>wherein all impiety is ≈øoone≈øt learned and attained.</p>
            <p>Their ignorance of Chri≈øt, his Per≈øon, Natures, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Undertakings for poor Souls, made me to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their wickedne≈øs, and to tell them they had wretchedly mi≈øpent their time, and that now they were going out of the World, they mu≈øt learn the Principles of Chri≈øtian Religion, and I que≈øtioned whether they had any Repentance that was plea≈øing unto God, for they had no Faith, nor knowledge, even of the mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary Truths, without which they could not be ≈øaved. And for my part I mu≈øt not flatter you, you are nearer Hell than Heaven. Upon this there was a di≈øcour≈øe made of Chri≈øt, adapted to their capacities, as al≈øo of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful love and conde≈øcen≈øion in becoming man, and dying for ≈øinners, and ≈øatisfying the Ju≈øtice of God, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his death as the price of Redemption unto all Penitent believers; and that this was now offered unto them upon the≈øe terms of confe≈ø≈øing and abhorring their ≈øins, and them≈øelves for their ≈øins: and that if they came to God with a ≈øence and feeling of the in≈øupportable burden, of the horrid nature, and infinite number of their ≈øins, and threw them≈øelves at his feet pro≈øtrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, imploring his mercy for the pa≈ø≈øion of his dear Son, the Lord would be merciful to them, and he would not ca≈øt them off, but would pardon and forgive their hainous and grievous offences.</p>
            <p>In the clo≈øe of this conference, Ma≈øter <hi>Holmes</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to the High Sheriff came into the Chamber, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øome words with the Malefactors, we joyntly parted the Pri≈øoners, I withdrawing into another Room with the Nur≈øe and Maid, and having pre≈ø≈øed them to a free &amp; ingenious confe≈ø≈øion of their Guilt, the Girl with tears in her eyes gave me for ≈øub≈øtance the ≈øame confe≈ø≈øion, and not varying in a circum≈øtance from that which at her fir≈øt apprehen≈øion ≈øhe had made unto the Major, and Ju≈øtice of <hi>Plymouth.</hi> I adjured her in the name of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96502:23"/>All-≈øeeing and heart-≈øearching God, who hated a Lye, and would ca≈øt all Lyars into the Lake of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone for ever, to declare nothing but the Truth: That ≈øhe had ≈øinned enough already, and had been Guilty of two Murders, and if the Nur≈øe were Innocent, ≈øhe ≈øhould not for a World accu≈øe her, for if ≈øhe did, the Lord might Damn her immediately.</p>
            <p>To which ≈øhe replied with Tears, <hi>Sir, I am a lo≈øt Creature, I have no hopes in this World, I would not willingly Damn my Soul, by drawing upon me the Guilt of more Blood, I ≈øpeak it as in the pre≈øence of God, I had not put in the Poy≈øon into the Pottage, had not the Nur≈øe bid me do it.</hi> And added, <hi>My Body is lo≈øt, but if the Lord would have pitty upon my Soul, it is all that I de≈øire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Nur≈øe hath ≈øaid, ≈øhe ≈øhould never confe≈øs, though ≈øhe did Hang for it. That I might confe≈øs what I would, ≈øhe would not confe≈øs any thing.</hi> Upon this I confronted her with <hi>Philip Cary,</hi> ≈øhe ob≈øtinately denies all, ≈øtands ≈øtifly to her Innocency, throws all upon the Girl; ≈øaith. Judge, Jury, and Witne≈ø≈øes, are all Guilty of her Innocent Blood, and ≈øhe will lay it at their Doors. Whereupon, I de≈øired the Maid to go in to Ma≈øter <hi>Holmes,</hi> and dealt privately with this Vile woman, yet to give Glory unto God by confe≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her ≈øin, and renouncing all commerce with Hell, that if ≈øhe did hide her ≈øin, and keep the Devils Coun≈øel, ≈øhe could never pro≈øper. That it was in vain for her to think of concealing it, for God knew it, the World knew it, her Country condemned her for it, her own con≈øcience, if ≈øhe had any left in her, mu≈øt needs accu≈øe and condemn her. Po≈ø≈øibly ≈øaid I, you think of life, and feed your ≈øelf with vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of e≈øcaping death, I told her they were fooli≈øh and groundle≈øs, that Ju≈øtice would have its Cour≈øe, that the whole World could not ≈øave her. That ≈øhe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96502:23"/>was already dead in Law, and mu≈øt be as certainly Executed, as ≈øhe was already Condemned. That ≈øhe ≈øtood upon the brink of the Pit, and was ready to drop down into the bottomle≈øs Gulph of Hell: That ≈øhe might, if ≈øhe would, e≈øcape it. God offered pardon, Life, Heaven and Salvation to her, provided ≈øhe would but give glory to him by confe≈ø≈øing her ≈øin, and taking the ≈øhame thereof unto her ≈øelf. That it was better to do it now than upon the Gallows. She had ≈øerved the Devil long enough, too too long, and it was a miracle of mercy, if ever the Lord ≈øhewed mercy to her at la≈øt; but yet I would, and did a≈ø≈øure her in his name, (as being his Amba≈ø≈øador, and ≈øent with his Commi≈ø≈øion to reconcile her unto God, whom ≈øhe had ≈øo hainou≈øly di≈øhonored,) that if ≈øhe would di≈øclo≈øe all this cur≈øed crime, who fir≈øt contrived it, who man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged it, and put her upon it, there was hopes. For the Lord was a merciful God unto unfeignd Penitents, and compa≈ø≈øionated her deplorable condition, and would bring her out of it. That ≈øhe take care not to Rebel again≈øt his grace, nor to tear a pardon, that was offered her upon ≈øuch ea≈øie terms, in pieces, nor to refu≈øe Heaven, and all its joys and happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alas! Sir,</hi> ≈øaith ≈øhe, <hi>What will you have me ≈øay? I will tell you all I know of it. I am as free from this Crime, as the Child that is now Born. But the Maid did it. For ≈øhe told me ≈øhe was weary of her life by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of her Mi≈øtris, who was ≈øuch a Cur≈øt Old Woman, that there was no living with her, and that ≈øhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to leave her Service, and go away with the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks, and that ≈øhe told me ≈øhe would fit her, and had bought the Rats-bane of the Mountebanks Boy or Man, with whom ≈øhe was in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was all I could get from her then, and not one Syllable of it true. I told her, ≈øhe ≈øhould beware of Lying, and fal≈øe Witne≈øs bearing, and not let the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96502:24"/>Devil ≈øit upon her heart and Tongue; and added, when you knew this Girl had an intent to make away her Mi≈øtris, why had not you di≈øcovered it? She ≈øaid, <hi>That indeed it was her fault, if it were a fault.</hi> I told her, con≈øent unto, and concealing of Murder, was Intentional Murder before God and Man, and that ≈øhe had a real hand in it. <hi>She told me ≈øhe had none at all, and could give me no other an≈øwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ≈øecret conference being ended, I brought the Maid again unto her, who avowed her former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, di≈øavowed all acquaintance with the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks Servant, never to have talked with him but once at the Conduit when ≈øhe fetcht water; and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to her face, that this wicked woman the Nur≈øe, did oftentimes per≈øwade her to run away from her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈øs, and if ≈øhe would have gone away the Saturday before the fact was committed, ≈øhe would help her to a Riding Suit.</p>
            <p>Unto this ≈øhe made no reply.</p>
            <p>Returning with them unto Ma≈øter <hi>Holmes,</hi> he pre≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them the evil of their ≈øin, advi≈øed them to Repentance: and be≈øpeaking the Nur≈øe, <hi>Philip Cary,</hi> ≈øaid he, there is a report and Su≈øpition of your having been unclean with your Ma≈øter. At which ≈øhe fell down upon her Knees in the mid≈øt of us, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated mo≈øt direfully upon her ≈øelf, is he ever knew her to be a man or woman, more than by giving ≈øuck unto his Grand Child.</p>
            <p>Having cleared her Ma≈øter, but not confe≈ø≈øing any other thing or ≈øin, Ma≈øter <hi>Holmes</hi> being de≈øired by me, concluded this conference with Prayer, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>In the evening I returned again unto the≈øe Pri≈øoners, And dealt with the Nur≈øe to acknowledge her Crime, freely to unbo≈øome her ≈øelf unto me, that I might ≈øpread it before the Lord in Prayer, and intreat
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96502:24"/>him for a broken heart, and a new Spirit for her.</p>
            <p>And withdrawing from the Company that crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us into a private Chamber, I de≈øired her for Gods ≈øake, her poor Souls ≈øake, (with cears in my eyes,) that ≈øhe would yet leave ≈øin before ≈øin left her, that ≈øhe would flee from that wrath to come, that ≈øhe would bid defiance unto the Devil, who ≈øhe ≈øaw had ruined her, and would Damn her everla≈øtingly; that ≈øhe would yet accept of grace and peace, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God; it was late indeed to return unto him, but not too late, how ever ≈øhe mu≈øt not thus dally with the Divine Maje≈øty, to put him off with delays and lies. That ≈øhe ≈øhould not be afraid of ≈øhame, that it was the greate≈øt ≈øhame and reproach unto her to have committed, and concealed this ≈øin; but it would be a ≈øtep to Honor and Eternal Glory to confe≈øs it, good men would then pitty her, pray for her, and God would ≈øave her.</p>
            <p>And added, that if ≈øhe would not confe≈øs it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly to the World, (which yet was her duty, and if ever the Lord gave her Repentance ≈øhe would do it more feely, and in a more ample manner than I could de≈øire,) ≈øhe ≈øhould at lea≈øt confe≈øs it unto me, and I promi≈øed her upon the word of a Mini≈øter, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her con≈øent I would never divulge it: Or if ≈øhe would not tru≈øt me with ≈øuch an important ≈øecret, I advi≈øed her to ≈øingle out ≈øome Godly Learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, or ≈øome Judicious private Chri≈øtian, to whom ≈øhe might Communicate it, and have the benefit of their A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, Coun≈øels, and Directions in order to her Salvation. That it was impo≈ø≈øible for her to get to Heaven without it. Confe≈ø≈øion being a main and principal ingredient into Repentance.</p>
            <p>To this ≈øhe an≈øwered po≈øitively ≈øhe would not, and as peremptorily, that it was enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96502:25"/>to God, and why ≈øhould ≈øhe confe≈øs unto men?</p>
            <p>I told her God required in publick, ≈øcandalous and crying Crimes, ≈øuch as tho≈øe whereof ≈øhe was Guilty, and e≈øpecially now the lot of God had attached her, and his holy righteous providence had condemned her, that ≈øhe ≈øhould confe≈øs, accu≈øe, ≈øhame and condemn her ≈øelf publickly. That otherwi≈øe ≈øhe ≈ølandered mo≈øt unworthily the Right Honorable Judge, and the whole Court; and endeavored to rai≈øe up a ba≈øe and ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ≈øu≈øpition of them, as if they had maliciou≈øly took away her life.</p>
            <p>To which ≈øhe in plain terms ≈øaid, <hi>They had, ≈øhe was Innocent, and they mu≈øt an≈øwer for it unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told her, I heard the Devil ≈øpeaking with her tongue, and was afraid to ≈øtay with her any longer, lea≈øt the ≈øhould tear her in a Thou≈øand pieces before me. I had known many hard-hearted Murderers this Thirteen years la≈øt pa≈øt in this Goal, but never before met with the like; That I ≈øaw, ≈øhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to be Damned, and go to Hell: And I was ≈øeriou≈øly per≈øwaded, that ≈øince ≈øo many Mini≈øters had been with her, and treated with her about everla≈øting life to no purpo≈øe, and that all my poor endeavors were un≈øuccesful, that God would never grant her Grace to repent, but that ≈øhe was a Ve≈ø≈øel of wrath, and preparing her ≈øelf a pace for endle≈øs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>At the≈øe words ≈øhe began to weep, and wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wringing her hands, crying, <hi>Oh! Sir, What ≈øhall I do? Will you have me ≈øpeak that which I do not know? I am Innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well woman ≈øaid I, if you be Innocent as to this Crime, tell me, are you not Guilty of ≈øome other Capital Crime de≈øerving death? For though the Lord
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96502:25"/>may ≈øuffer an Innocent per≈øon to undergo an unju≈øt Sentence from men, yet if he have any Grace, he will own the Ju≈øtice of God in mans inju≈øtice. It is rare, very rare indeed, that God the Wi≈øe and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Governor of the World ≈øuffers the Innocent to be Condemned, and the Guilty ab≈øolved; but if he do, is there not a Cau≈øe for it? Were I in your Ca≈øe, I would ≈øay unto the Lord, do not Condemn me, ≈øhew me wherefore thou contende≈øt with me? Come, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rip your heart, and tell me what ≈øins thou ha≈øt been Guilty of, that though you need no Repentance for this Murder for which as you ≈øay, you are unju≈øtly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, yet you may be holpen unto Repentance for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, I know no ≈øin at all that I am Guilty of,</hi> is her reply. <hi>No Sir, none at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah! poor wretch, Guilty of no ≈øin? Is not thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depraved? Hath not thy life been debauched? How ha≈øt thou improved thy time here in Pri≈øon? In Prayers, Repentance, and preparation for death.</p>
            <p>Still ≈øhe an≈øwers, <hi>No ≈øin de≈øerving death:</hi> It may be ≈øhe had committed ≈øome little ≈øins as all others do, but for ≈øins de≈øerving death, ≈øhe never had committed any.</p>
            <p>I told her ≈øhe was a perfect ≈øtranger to her own heart, that ≈øhe was full of ≈øin all over, but blind and could not ≈øee them; that her little ≈øins were all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and as ≈øhe knew one drop of Poy≈øon would kill as bad as a Spoonful, ≈øo one little ≈øin without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance would as infallibly Damn her as the greate≈øt; that for my part I did utterly de≈øpair of her Salvation, ≈øeeing the Devil to be ≈øo ≈øtrong in her, that ≈øhe was in the Gall of bitterne≈øs and bond of Iniquity, and ≈øeared that ≈øhe would go to Hell with a lye in her mouth; ≈øhe was now plea≈øing the Devil, and thought
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96502:26"/>≈øhe had found his Service ≈øo profitable and beneficial to her, that ≈øhe was re≈øolved to ≈øerve him to the la≈øt, and to hear the <hi>Lord Thunder in her Ears, Go! Thou Cur≈øed Murdere≈øs into everla≈øting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this ≈øhe wept again, and told me ≈øhe was a poor<note n="*" place="margin">Ignorant.</note> 
               <hi>Ingrant Soul.</hi> But ≈øhe hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would not be ≈øo bad with her as I ≈øpake.</p>
            <p>I told her it was my hearts de≈øire it might not be ≈øo. I pittied her from my Soul. I labored for her everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing welfare. I had no other de≈øign upon her than to pluck her out of the Jaws of Hell. That I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but labor for my pains, and was afraid I ≈øhould be a Witne≈øs at the la≈øt day again≈øt her for her refu≈øal, her ≈øtubborn, wilful rejection of everla≈øting life.</p>
            <p>That ≈øo her Brother had done before her, and would never repent, nor confe≈øs, till he was upon the Gallows ready to be turned over, and then out all came, when he could live no longer to the Devil, then he would go to God; and God mu≈øt be put off with the Devils leavings.</p>
            <p>To which ≈øhe rejoyned, that her Brother had made a Godly end, and ≈øhe was ≈øure he was now in Heaven, and did wi≈øh ≈øhe might make as good an End. <hi>And ≈øaid I, I pray God you may make a better!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the Curio≈øity of my Reader, who will inquire concerning her Brother, may be ≈øatisfied: I ≈øhall give an account of him briefly, craving pardon for amu≈øeing him with this Digre≈ø≈øion. Take then his and ≈øub≈øcribed with his own hand at <hi>Lance≈øton</hi> in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, April</hi> the Third, 1675.

That the Fire which was to con≈øume her in <hi>Plymouth</hi> would be very painful, but the Fire of Hell in which ≈øhe mu≈øt live and lye for ever would be in≈øupportable. That her many and mighty ≈øins had brought her to this woful condition. And I added, <hi>How will you get out of it?</hi>

            <p>Poor wretch! She fell a trembling and weeping, and de≈øired my help and direction, and ≈øhe would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to follow it.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, my Bowels yearning on her, and mingling my tears with hers, I told her I was heartily glad to hear ≈øuch words drop from her mouth, and through Gods ble≈ø≈øing ≈øhe would never want it.</p>
            <p>Then I told her. <hi>Anne,</hi> do you ≈øit down in ≈øome ≈øecret place, and review your life, and look over all your ways, and call your ≈øelf to an account for all the ≈øins that you can remember your ≈øelf Guilty of; and con≈øider chiefly that your heart and nature are de≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, that there dwelleth in you nothing that is good, and that you cannot do any thing that is good, no not ≈øo much of your ≈øelf as think a good thought, much le≈øs to Convert and turn your ≈øelf to God. Then remember every one of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and how that you have tran≈øgre≈øt again≈øt them, e≈øpecially again≈øt the Sixth. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not kill;</hi> and that for every one of the≈øe ≈øins of yours, even for the lea≈øt you have de≈øerved to burn in Hell: Oh! Then how many Hells have you merited.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, con≈øider all the mercies of God be≈øtowed upon you, as your <hi>Life, Health, Liberty, Friends, Food;</hi> and to live in a Land where the Go≈øpel is preached, and the way to Heaven revealed and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and yet how unworthily have you abu≈øed them to the di≈øhonor of the Lord that gave them. But principally con≈øider that all your ≈øins have been committed again≈øt God the Father, that Created you, that gave you life and being, again≈øt God the Son Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who became man, and died for you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne,</hi> ≈øaid I, this makes your ≈øin exceeding ≈øinful, a very horrible ≈øin, that Chri≈øt Je≈øus to ≈øave you from ≈øin and Hell, died for you, was crucified and accur≈øed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96502:29"/>for you, lo≈øt his heart blood for you, and underwent the torments of Hell for you, to keep and ≈øave you from them: And yet by every ≈øin that you have been Guilty of, you have Crucified Chri≈øt afre≈øh, you have ≈øtabbed him to the heart, drawn fre≈øh blood from him. For not one of your ≈øins can be pardoned without his blood, and you have been very prodigal of it, to ≈øpill, and de≈øpi≈øe, and trample it under Foot, which is Helli≈øh ingratitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will you ≈øet home this meditation upon your Heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, con≈øider, that you have ≈øinned again≈øt the Holy Spirit of God, who ≈øanctified you in Bapti≈øm unto his Service; and that quite contrary to the end and intent of God in Baptizing you, that you might repent, and renounce ≈øin, you have wallowed in it all your daies, and grieved the good Spirit of God, and only gratified and ≈øerved the Devil.</p>
            <p>And having done this, do you throw your ≈øelf not upon your knees, but flat upon your face, upon the earth before God, and think as if you were at the very mouth of Hell, and ready to be ca≈øt headlong into the torments of it; that are endle≈øs, ea≈øele≈øs, and remedile≈øs; and then with ≈øhowrs of tears, and with as much <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> as you can po≈ø≈øibly confe≈øs all the≈øe ≈øins unto God, and beg of God to give you Repentance unto life, to <hi>Weep, Mourn,</hi> and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded for them; and never ≈øeave <hi>Praying, Sighing,</hi> and <hi>Groaning</hi> unto God in Prayer, till he do make your hard heart wax ≈øoft within you, and that you be chiefly aba≈øed and humbled, that you have ≈øinned again≈øt God, who is your be≈øt Friend, Saviour, and alone Comforter.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, do this at night upon your Bed, and be up early at this work, and de≈øire the Lord that your late Repentance, may be a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

            <p>Having promi≈øed me, that ≈øhe would take this cour≈øe, we came out unto the other Pri≈øoners. And ≈øpeaking unto the Man condemned for coyning, I told him, and his Companion who ≈øtole a Mare, (but is ≈øince mercifully reprieved,) That God had ≈øaid, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not Steal,</hi> and as he that Murdered by Gods Law de≈øerved everla≈øting death in Hell, ≈øo by that ≈øame Law, did he that ≈øtole; that burning in Hell was a wor≈øe puni≈øhment than hanging upon a Gallows.</p>
            <p>That it was a wickedne≈øs again≈øt the light of nature that they were guilty of: That the very Heathen who knew not God, puni≈øhed it with as much ≈øeverity as our Laws.</p>
            <p>That they would not willingly have others ≈øo u≈øe them, to take away their goods from them:</p>
            <p>That every Man had a Right, Title and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the fruit of his own and hone≈øt Labors.</p>
            <p>That it was a ≈øin again≈øt the whole Land, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to invade the Prerogatives of the King, ≈øuch as coyning was, being in≈øeparable from the Crown, and a mo≈øt glorious Flower of it.</p>
            <p>That he who would ≈øtrike at the Royalties of the King, would never ≈øtick nor boggle to make away the Life of the King, which was ≈øuch a piece of damnable impiety in it ≈øelf and con≈øequences, that none but an incarnate Devil would be guilty of.</p>
            <p>That they ≈øhould do well to ≈øeek the pace of God in time, and to wre≈øtle mightily with him for Grace, Repentance, and Forgivene≈øs, that ≈øo they might not peri≈øh everla≈øtingly. Their time was ≈øhort, their work great, it was no ea≈øie matter to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>That I had known many very holy, mortified, and godly Per≈øons that had ≈øpent Three≈øcore years in a Religious Life, and clo≈øe walking with God, yet to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96502:30"/>be full of fears and doubts they ≈øhould never get to Heaven. And that they had much more cau≈øe to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>And in the up≈øhot told them, that if they would ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly and heartily embrace and follow the≈øe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, if they would to day, whil≈øt it is called to day, hearken to the Voice of God, and nor harden their Hearts, there was hope for them in their latter end, For their was forgivene≈øs with God that he might he feared, yea with the Lord there was mercy, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Redemption. Other Mini≈øters coming in, I bad them farewel for the pre≈øent.</p>
            <p>THe next morning about Eight of the Clock, I vi≈øited them again, and ≈øound with them Mr. <hi>G. T.</hi> a worthy Mini≈øter of <hi>Exon,</hi> who gave me an account of the un≈øuccesfulne≈øs of his Labors, as to that wicked Woman the Nur≈øe; and then in a very pathetical and devout prayer, mo≈øt pertinent to their conditions, with great meltings of his own heart and affections, commended them unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, I dealt again with the Nur≈øe, but no more privately as heretofore; I urged her to repent of her horrid Murders, to acknowledg them, and take the ≈øhame of them to her ≈øelf: That ≈øhe mu≈øt do it. God and Man, Heaven and Earth required it from her mouth.</p>
            <p>She ≈øtill asks me, <hi>Sir, what will you have me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs an untruth unto you, a matter of which I am not Guilty?</hi> I told her that none believed her, that it was a mo≈øt improbable thing that tho≈øe Per≈øons who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øed again≈øt her, ≈øome of them being to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg Per≈øons fearing God, hating a lie, ≈øhould ever accu≈øe her fal≈øly. They had no temptations to it, ≈øhe never having wronged nor offended them, that as far as I knew, the were as much her Friends, as her
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96502:30"/>Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes, that there was neither profit, nor advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nor plea≈øure, nor honor accrewing to them in taking away her life, and they were too tender, and made more Con≈øcience than ≈øo, to draw upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves the guilt of innocent Blood.</p>
            <p>And finally, I told her, that ≈øhe had<note n="*" place="margin">made</note> ≈øwopt a Bargain with the Devil for ≈øecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to her own de≈øtruction, that all would out at la≈øt, as cunningly and clo≈øely as ≈øhe did carry it, before Men and Angels; and ≈øaid I, you are one of the mo≈øt bloody Women, that ever came into this Goal, you are guilty of Two Murthers upon your Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes, guilty of a Third before God, having drawn in this poor Girl like a Devil, as you are, to joyn with you to ruin them and her ≈øelf al≈øo, and though ≈øhe ≈øuffered ju≈øtly from Man, yet her Blood would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from your hands by God, and then you mu≈øt an≈øwer for the ≈øhortning of her days, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction ≈øhe and you have brought upon her ≈øelf; ≈øo that ≈øhe was drowned over and over in Blood-guiltine≈øs: And I did as verily believe ≈øhe would be in Hell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs there were a very wonderful change wrought upon her, as that old Murderer her Father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was.</p>
            <p>The≈øe words extorted tears from her, but no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øhe prayed me to have better thoughts and hopes of her. I told her, I wi≈øh I had ≈øome grounds for them, but I could have none, till I ≈øaw her ≈øtony Heart rent and ≈øhivered to pieces, and her Bones broken under the ≈øence of her Helli≈øh wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and ≈øhe did not continue to reject the Coun≈øels of God to her own de≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>Upon this her Accu≈øers, that unthought of, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, were at the Door, being admitted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with her; and I betook my ≈øelf to the poor Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the Maid.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:96502:31"/>
            <p>This is a ≈øad, too ≈øad a Truth. After condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion crowds of vulgar Per≈øons throng in upon the≈øe Malefactors: The covetous Keepers for love of a piece of money letting them in, who by their loo≈øe; idle, and impertinent di≈øcour≈øes, ob≈øtruct the ≈øucce≈øs of Mini≈øterial Labors. However this poor Maid a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, that her thoughts had been upon my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels in the night, and ≈øhe wou'd make it her bu≈øine≈øs to do it more effectually, and withal, added that ≈øhe ≈øaw her ≈øelf undone for ever.</p>
            <p>To which I replied, No, ≈øhe was nearer Heaven than ≈øhe was aware of. That her ≈øins were not too great for God to pardon. That ≈øhe ≈øhould remember Three Texts of Scripture that I would tell her.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>This is a true and faithful ≈øaying, worthy of her acceptation, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt came into the world to ≈øave ≈øinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Yea Sir, (≈øaith ≈øhe,) I am the greate≈øt ≈øinner in <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That who≈øoever comes unto Chri≈øt,</hi> that is, <hi>believes in Chri≈øt, he would in no wi≈øe ca≈øt out.</hi> That for her to believe in and come to Chri≈øt, was no other than this; That ≈øeeing her ≈øelf by rea≈øon of ≈øin to be a damned Wretch, ≈øhe ca≈øt her ≈øelf upon the everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies of God becau≈øe of Chri≈øts death, with hope and expectation of them, and waiting for them.</p>
            <p>And then Thirdly, <hi>That the Blood of Chri≈øt clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth from all ≈øins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ≈øhe ≈øhould meditate and think upon the≈øe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious words of God, and re≈øolve that ≈øhe would live and die with them in her Heart. And if ≈øhe did, and grieved unfeignedly for her ≈øins, loathed them, and her ≈øelf for them, my Soul for hers, ≈øhe ≈øhould never peri≈øh. For Je≈øus Chri≈øt was a mo≈øt ab≈øolute and compleat Saviour, able and willing to ≈øave the wor≈øt of Mankind, that would be ≈øaved by him upon the≈øe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96502:31"/>his Terms, and therefore would ≈øave her. Upon this ≈øhe wept again.</p>
            <p>Having comforted her, and done ≈øomewhat to bind up her wounds; I added, <hi>Anne,</hi> there are yet ≈øome other works for you; you mu≈øt die in Charity with the world, and crave pardon as from God, ≈øo from Man, e≈øpecially from your Ma≈øter whom you have ≈øo grievou≈øly wronged. You mu≈øt al≈øo in particular for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give this bloody Woman the Nur≈øe, that hath ≈øedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you to this great ≈øin, and to your perdition. Will you? Can you do it? If you do it not from your heart, God will never forgive you. <hi>Sir,</hi> ≈øaith ≈øhe, <hi>I wit, I do it. And it ≈øhould not grieve me if ≈øhe lived, though l died only for this Fact. I forgive her, a I expect forgivene≈øs from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I added, She mu≈øt beware of mi≈øpending her time, or loo≈øing a moment of it; ≈øhe ≈øhould take heed of vain thoughts, ≈øhe mu≈øt be much in private Prayer, and not be long, but ≈øhort, ≈øhort in Prayer, but often. She mu≈øt hearken to all the good coun≈øels of Gods Mini≈øters that would come and vi≈øit her, and do them to the utmo≈øt. She ≈øhould be as Spiritual, Holy, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, Humble, Serious, and Heavenly minded as po≈ø≈øible. She ≈øhould not take any great care of her Body, the le≈øs the better, as to eating, drinking, or ≈øleep: Her whole thoughts and care ≈øhould be ≈øpent about her Soul, and its ≈øalvation.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, <hi>Anne,</hi> ≈øaid I, it is a hard work to die at any time, but for one in thy condition very hard indeed. But however, once thy peace is made with God, and thou ha≈øt repented of thy ≈øin, and thrown thy poor Soul upon Sovereign mercy in the Blood of Je≈øus, never fear death. Take it humbly, patiently, and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øively. Bear the indignation of the Lord becau≈øe thou ha≈øt ≈øinned, accept of the puni≈øhment of thine iniquity, yea be thankful unto God, that thou
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96502:32"/>maye≈øt be Burnt here and not hereafter. I hope the Lord will make thy death ea≈øie, ≈øhort, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Thou art yet a ≈øtranger to the joys of Gods Salvation, and to the comforts of his Holy Spirit: But it may be the Lord will give them to thee in thy bitter torments, and then thou wilt ≈øcarce feel them; or if he ≈øhall detain them from thee, yet his Grace is ≈øufficient for thee; believe in the Lord Je≈øus, and thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved.</p>
            <p>And fini≈øhing my di≈øcour≈øe with her, ≈øhe asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhe ≈øhould not ≈øee me again, e≈øpecially when ≈øhe was to ≈øuffer, for ≈øhe earne≈øtly reque≈øted my help, my a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to her in that hour.</p>
            <p>I promi≈øed, if it could be obtained, ≈øhe ≈øhould have it.</p>
            <p>Being now returned to the re≈øt of the Malefactors, I ≈øpake ≈øomething of the Glories of that other World, where truly Penitent and believing ≈øinners were a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what an un≈øpeakable happine≈øs God had prepared for them, and what wonderful rich grace this was on Gods part, that he ≈øhould promi≈øe and tender it unto them. Two of whom I hope were broken hearted, though they wanted much knowledge, and much of that Compunction that they ought to have; that if they would endeavor after more Grace, God, who was the God of all Grace, would give liberally unto them, and never upbraid them with their pa≈øt ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs.</p>
            <p>That the promi≈øes were not made ≈øo much unto the mea≈øure and degree of Grace, as to the nature and Truth of Grace: That a Grain of Gold was as truly Gold, as an heap or Mountain; That the Lord was no re≈øpecter of Per≈øons, but an Univer≈øal, a Common Saviour: That he de≈øpi≈øed not the day of ≈ømall things, <hi>He would not quench the ≈ømoaking Flax, nor break the brui≈øed Reed,</hi> nor ca≈øt off any ≈øelf-confounded, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96502:32"/>≈øelf-condemned wrerches. That whatever their ≈øins had been, they ≈øhould beware of doubting or de≈øpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods mercies. Their de≈øpair of Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater ≈øin than Murder or High Trea≈øon. That I was not ignorant of Satans devices, no ≈øtranger to his Wiles and Stratagems, who when he could keep them no longer in Chains of darkne≈øs and Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would put Souls upon Over-doing in Repentance, and over whelm them with horrors.</p>
            <p>They ≈øhould look to this and believe it, live and die upon it, that Chri≈øt Je≈øus was more willing to ≈øave them, than they were to be ≈øaved by him, that though they were to die ≈øhameful and painful deaths, you to be Hanged; and you to be Burnt. Yet here was a comfortable meditation, it was as ea≈øie going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the Stake and Gallows, as from their Beds; and when their Souls were departing out of their Bodies, Gods Holy Angels would convey them into Paradi≈øe.</p>
            <p>At this good news my Two Penitents wept; and I hope Tears of Joy.</p>
            <p>And turning my ≈øelf unto the Nur≈øe, Woman, ≈øaid I, it is the very grief of my Soul, and makes my heart bleed within me, that not one Syllable or tittle of the≈øe good words of Gods gracious promi≈øes belongs to thee. <hi>This is the Children Bread, it mu≈øt not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Dogs and Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having fini≈øhed my di≈øcour≈øe, I gathered up the particulars, and ≈øpread them before the Lord in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, begging grace and glory for them: And that his Divine Maje≈øty would yet mollifie that Adamant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and take away the heart of ≈øtone, and give an heart of fle≈øh, and open the Brazen Doors that this Captive of Hell might go forth, and give glory to him by a full and ingenious Confe≈ø≈øion, and find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ere ≈øhe went hence, and ≈øhould be ≈øeen no more.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96502:33"/>
            <p>Taking my leave of them, hoping another day to ≈øee them in Heaven, I departed the Chamber. As I was going out the Nur≈øe pulls me by the Coat, de≈øiring private conference with me.</p>
            <p>This very much ≈øurprized me, conceiving that ≈øhe began to relent, and that Satan was a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But I was mi≈øerably mi≈øtaken, when with Tears in her eyes ≈øhe intreated me to deal effectually with the Maid, to declare who ≈øet her upon it to accu≈øe her, that ≈øhe might know them that contrived her death.</p>
            <p>I told her, I had already; and in Three conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could never find her to vary one tittle. That I ≈øaw the Maid ingenious and Penitent, but had not the lea≈øt token of true Repentance from her; That ≈øhe was a Brazen Impudent Hypocrite, thus to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemble with God and Man, to pretend Innocency, when her own Con≈øcience convinces her of the Guilt of ≈øo much blood. That ≈øhe ≈øhould not deceive her ≈øelf, God would not be mocked, as ≈øhe had Sown ≈øo ≈øhe ≈øhould Reap. She kept the Devils Coun≈øel, and to the Devil ≈øhe would go. I had ≈øpent my time and Spirits for the good of her Soul, but I ≈øaw no good i≈ø≈øue thereof; and therefore look to it Woman, Look to it, that this do not make thy Hell hotter than Ordinary.</p>
            <p>And then added one word, Prethee tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ha≈øt no ≈øin at all upon thy Spirit, that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No, Sir, none it all I thank God. I never wronged any one in my life. I never hurt my Mi≈øtris, nor took a Needle of Threed from her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I asked her father. Whether ≈øhe had not the Gold which her Brother ≈øtole from Ma≈øter <hi>Northam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>She ≈øaid No.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:96502:33"/>
            <p>I told her my Intelligence came from her own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who avowed that her Brother gave it her in a Paper to take to his Child, and that ≈øhe took it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the Child, but then immediately took it from him again.</p>
            <p>All which ≈øhe ≈øtiffly denies, maintaining ≈øhe never ≈øaw nor knew of One Farthing of that Money, either Gold or Silver: That her Brother was too wi≈øe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øt it to her a poor Woman for his Child, who had a Child of her own. But this is downright Lying and aequivocation, as you will hear at the day of her Execution.</p>

            <p>I am ≈øorry that no Memorials of their Pious Labors, and Divine Di≈øcour≈øes are fallen into my Hands, that might have enricht the Soul of my Reader, and been an embelli≈øhment to this cour≈øe Paper.</p>

            <p>What ever the effect and Fruit of their labors was, ≈øhe gave them this en≈øuing Confe≈ø≈øion, which one of tho≈øe Reverend Mini≈øters, that panted after her Souls Salvation, took from her mouth, and hath Cloathed it in the≈øe words.</p>

         <div type="confession">
            <head>The Ingenious and true Confe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Anne Evans,</hi> concerning the horrid and cruel Murder of <hi>Elizabeth Weeks,</hi> and <hi>Mary Pengelley.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ENvy being once at the height, it put in Execution with a Witne≈øs. This Nur≈øe having by ≈øome means cau≈øed her Husband to receive words from her Mi≈øtris, he was plea≈øed to be very angry with his Wi≈øe for the ≈øame, and withal threatens her to leave her. And departed for a Fortnights time; whereupon began an hatching of this Barbarous action by the ≈øaid Nur≈øe, ≈øaying ≈øhe would fit her for it; for ≈øhe her Mi≈øtris was the cau≈øe of her Husbands going from her, (as ≈øhe ≈øaid) and endeavored to put it in practi≈øe with per≈øwading the ≈øaid <hi>Anne Evans</hi> to go to Ma≈øter <hi>Mathews</hi> the Apothecary for <hi>Ratsbane,</hi> telling her ≈øhe ≈øhould ask it for the poy≈øoning of Rats and Mice, ≈øaying, it will do her work in as ≈øhort a time as one might go to the Gate and back again, and then they ≈øhould live as merry as the days were long, when the old Devil was gone. Saying, ≈øhe knew one who was poy≈øoned in as little time with it and ≈øome Cream.</p>
            <p>Whereupon like a true and Faithful Servant, the ≈øaid <hi>Anne Evans</hi> refu≈øeth and rejects the ≈øaid ≈øayings, and would by no means do it.</p>
            <p>Here we mu≈øt ≈øtop a while, and give you to under≈øtand how much this poor Creature lived in fear of the Nur≈øe, and by that means neglected the di≈øcovery of it to the de≈øtroying of her Body, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96502:36"/>of her Soul. For there is mercy with the Lord, that he may be Feared.</p>
            <p>Now the Devil having once got hold on her Heart, neglects no opportunities, but puts her on it with great ≈øubtilties and invention: The Nur≈øe laying, as it is ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed by all circum≈øtances, a clean Paper twi≈øted at both ends with Poy≈øon in it in the path of the Garden; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this <hi>Anne Evans</hi> was to go forth to gather Herbs to put into the Pot, (according to her Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,) ≈øhe finds the Paper lying in her way, which ≈øhe took up, and brought in, and ≈øhews it to this Nur≈øe again, asking her what it was, who pretended ≈øhe knew not, and with all bidding her put it out of her hand, the Nur≈øe eyed her where ≈øhe lay'd it, which was in the Kitchin on a ≈øhelf.</p>
            <p>Going afterward to the Conduit for Water, at her return it came into her mind, to look on that thing once more, which ≈øhe had taken up in the Garden, and it was gone off from the ≈øhelf; which no body el≈øe could take but the ≈øaid Nur≈øe, for it was at Eight of the Clock at night, and no body there but ≈øhe.</p>
            <p>Then the ≈øaid <hi>Anne Evans</hi> ≈øaw her grinding it on the Harth with Two Tiles, and demanding her what ≈øhe was doing, ≈øhe cryed Peace! we ≈øhall have brave sport, if you will but put this into the old Womans Di≈øh. She through her enticements and ≈øtrong per≈øwa≈øions, not knowing what it was, or that the end of it would be death, being not willing to have her displea≈øure. For ≈øhe lived in great fear of offending the Nur≈øe, becau≈øe ≈øhe was in great favor with the young Mi≈øtre≈øs, thinking that if ≈øhe did not con≈øent to her reque≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhould fare the wor≈øe for it.</p>
            <p>And further the ≈øaid <hi>Anne Evans</hi> doth te≈øtifie that the ≈øame Sunday ≈øhe was ≈øent for ≈øome drink, which ≈øhe brought to the Nur≈øe, and the Nur≈øe did Warm it, and put a bit of Bread into it, and drank up a good draught
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96502:36"/>of it, and filled it up again afterward with other drink, in which ≈øhe had ≈øteeped ≈øome of that Powder all night, and gave it to the old Mi≈øtri≈øs to drink.</p>
            <p>Here is a Con≈øe≈ø≈øion Harmonical with that ≈øhe made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, ≈øhe varied nothing from fir≈øt to la≈øt in it. So that as the Serpent drew in <hi>Eve,</hi> in like manner did this wicked Nur≈øe beguile this poor Maid into the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øion.</p>

            <p>ON Wedne≈øday the 29. of <hi>March,</hi> they left <hi>Exon,</hi> and were brought on Hor≈øeback to <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> in order to their execution.</p>
            <p>At the Bridg end, as they were coming out of the City, that vile Woman was heard to lay unto the Hangman boa≈øtingly, <hi>That ≈øhe had known many Men in her life,</hi> and u≈øed ≈øeveral other ob≈øcene expre≈ø≈øions, that I will not ≈øoil my Paper, nor make my Reader blu≈øh at the Relation of them.</p>
            <p>In their journey, the Girl was very pen≈øive, cared for little or no refre≈øhment, and at the la≈øt place where they baited, being de≈øired to take ≈øome ≈øu≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; ≈øhe replied, <hi>There was other work for her than to eat or drink, ≈øhe had a Soul to ≈øave, would look wholly after that, and no more care for her Body; which ≈øhould neither eat, nor drink more in this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nur≈øe was of a far different temper and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, far from ≈øeriou≈øne≈øs, or thoughts of Death and Eternity; The Executioner was her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and if he had not defiled her, they are both abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably wronged.</p>
            <p>Now they return again to <hi>Plymouth.</hi> At their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance they are attended by Thou≈øands of People. Per≈øons of all Age and Quality ran to meet them.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96502:37"/>They are gazed at as ≈øo many Mon≈øters. Every one pa≈ø≈øeth his cen≈øure on them; ≈øome with bowels of pitty on the poor Girl, ≈øcarce any one hath Charity for the Nur≈øe. They went from this Town with their ≈øin, and under guilt: They return unto it with ≈øhame, and ≈øorrow, and under wrath.</p>
            <p>Being conducted unto their Chamber, the Reverend and Learned Mini≈øters of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Dr. <hi>A≈øhton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Collings,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Read</hi> vi≈øits them, and di≈øcour≈øe with them, but the Throng of Spectators was ≈øo great, that for the pre≈øent much good could not be done by them. Yet ≈øo ≈øtrong a flame of divine love toward the Souls of the≈øe condemned wretches was kindled in the hearts of tho≈øe grave Divines, that they return again unto them after Ten, and though late at night, yet ≈øpent a con≈øiderable ≈øpace of time in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious conferences with them, and mu≈øter up all their arguments to induce that ob≈øtinate ≈øinner the Nur≈øe to confe≈øs, and for≈øake the Devil, and to accept of Gods tender mercies. But the flinty Rock will ≈øooner gu≈øh out with Waters, and the Adamant be broken to pieces by the Hammer, than her unmoveable Soul utter forth one Syllable of guilt. Heart-work, is hard work. None but the Divine and Omnipotent Arm can unlock it's Doors, or break its Bars in pieces.</p>
            <p>With the Maid they had no difficulty, ≈øhe owneth, and confe≈ø≈øeth all. Her de≈øires are for mercy at the hands of God, acknowledging ≈øhe de≈øerved and expected none from Men.</p>
            <p>They conclude their charitable Vi≈øit with ≈øeeking God, the Reverend Doctor praying mo≈øt fervently for them.</p>
            <p>I al≈øo vi≈øited them again, and renued my a≈ø≈øaults and batteries again≈øt this ≈øtrong hold of the Devil; but ≈øhe re≈øi≈øts, ≈øtands out again≈øt God, and all his

            </p>
            <p>It was high time to leave her, upon whom no good impre≈ø≈øions could be wrought.</p>
            <p>I then betook my ≈øelf to the poor Penitent, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her how ≈øhe did, How it went with her Soul?

            </p>
            <p>And afterward inquiring of her into the grounds and rea≈øons of this her confidence, ≈øhe told me, <hi>she ≈øaw her ≈øin, ≈øhe was unfeignedly ≈øorry for it, and not only that it was committed again≈øt her Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes, and had rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, and her ≈øelf here; but chiefly this grieved her, that ≈øhe had thereby di≈øhonored God her Heavenly Father, who had made her, and Je≈øus Chri≈øt who had died for her, and God the Holy Gho≈øt, who had ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her to become his Servant. That however, ≈øhe would not de≈øpare of mercy. For the Thief upon the Cro≈øs found mercy from our Saviour at the la≈øt hour, and I Que≈øtion not, that he my Saviour hath mercy for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, I give thee her very words, neither adding to them, nor ≈øub≈øtracting from them; and if they do

            <p>Her Si≈øters being come to her weeping and crying, ≈øhe was de≈øired to ≈øpeak to them, and urged becau≈øe her time was ≈øhort, ≈øhe an≈øwered, <hi>My time is ≈øhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and I am drawing near unto Eternity, but I hope in God to an Eternity of Happine≈øs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My great work now was to ≈øettle her Spirit, and to corroborate her Soul again≈øt the horrors of her death; and told her after many other di≈øcour≈øes, <hi>Anne,</hi> thou art happier than many here, for I hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Twenty four hours be pa≈øt, thou wilt be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

            <p>
               <hi>Yea Sir,</hi> ≈øaith ≈øhe, <hi>I believe, and receive this true and faithful ≈øaying, worthy of all acceptation, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt came into the world to ≈øave ≈øinners, of whom I am chief.</hi>

            <p>Having got a little ≈øilence, (and very little indeed it was, the noi≈øe and tumult of the people ever and anon drowning my voice,) I prayed with the≈øe Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and wi≈øhed them a good Night.</p>
            <p>But ≈øleep they did not. Every hour increa≈øeth their fears.</p>
            <p>The day of their Execution is now come, and early in the morning I gave them another vi≈øit, comforted and confirmed the poor Maid, who de≈øired me not to leave her at her ≈øufferings, and dealt again with the Nur≈øe, though to as little purpo≈øe as formerly, and then ≈øought God by Prayer in their behalf.</p>
            <p>That duty fini≈øhed, Turning my di≈øcour≈øe to the Maid, <hi>Anne,</hi> ≈øaid I, Thy time flies away, thy end is very near, take off thy heart wholly from the world. Be dead unto thy Relations, tell them, the be≈øt ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and kindne≈øs they can do thee is not to ≈øee thee, but pray for thee, and let all thy thoughts and de≈øires
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96502:38"/>be unto God, to be at home with him: long now to be in Heaven and Glory, turn thy Face to the Wall, ≈øince thou ha≈øt no private Room, and power out thy Soul before the Lord, and wait, yea wait earne≈øtly for, his Salvation.</p>
            <p>Do not fear the Fire, God will carry thee thorough it, it can only hurt thy Body, it ≈øhall not ≈øinge thy Soul. Though thy Fle≈øh and thy Bones be con≈øumed, thou wilt have many Mourners, and God, I hope will gather thine A≈øhes, and grant thee a Glorious <hi>Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> I want words to tell thee what the Joys of Heaven are, but thou wilt ≈øee, and feel, and ta≈øt, and injoy them very ≈øhortly. I hope this day thou wilt be with the Lord, and all his ble≈ø≈øed Saints, and glorious Angels in Paradi≈øe. She ≈øaid, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwith≈øtanding my ill ≈øucce≈øs and many repul≈øes hitherto, yet I would not leave the Nur≈øe. I rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øtill with my ≈øelf, who knoweth but that Grace may be given, and Satan may loo≈øe his hold fa≈øt, and the <hi>Prey may be taken out of the Paws of the ≈øpoiler, out of the jaws of the Devourer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Satan hath fallen as a fla≈øh of lightning before the Mini≈øtry of Gods Holy word, God hath him in a Chain, and though ≈øhe hath not li≈øtened to the voice of former admonitions, it may be ≈øhe ≈øhall now unto the la≈øt.</p>
            <p>Addre≈ø≈øing my ≈øelf, therefore once again unto her, I told her, Nur≈øe, this is the la≈øt conference that ever I will have with thee on Earth about thy Soul, and nothing but my real ≈øence of its worth, and lothne≈øs that it ≈øhould be lo≈øt for ever, would ever have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to it. That I got nothing but trouble, grief, and lo≈øs of time thus to wait upon her, and not to be able to do good. I knew indeed my reward was with the Lord, and my work with my God, but yet I demanded this poor ≈øatisfaction of her now at parting,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96502:39"/>that ≈øhe ≈øhould not ≈øend me away with the ≈øad thoughts of her damnation.</p>
            <p>To which ≈øhe very civilly replyed, <hi>Sir, I thank you for all your love to my Soul. I believe that what you have done and ≈øpoken, hath been in order to my Eternal good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, I added, ≈øhall you and I have a little private di≈øcour≈øe together? She agreed. De≈øiring therefore the people to withdraw at a di≈øtance, I askt her in her Ear whether ≈øhe were Guilty or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> (≈øaith ≈øhe,) <hi>I will tell you all I know</hi> ‚Äî Then ≈øtopt, at length the repeats again. <hi>I will tell you all I know</hi>‚ÄîAnd then ≈øtops.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I told her, Nur≈øe, the Devil is leaving thee, God is coming in with mercy, do not now at the la≈øt hour refu≈øe it, tell me what you know of this bu≈øine≈øs, and I a≈ø≈øure thee upon the word of a Mini≈øter, that without thy con≈øent I will not di≈øclo≈øe it. Do not fear ≈øhame, ≈øhame the Devil, and give Glory to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, I confe≈øs, I did put the Spider into the Cup, and bad the Girl to ≈øquat it abroad; but it was a Fooli≈øh and vain word, I never intended any more hurt to my Mi≈øtris, than I do to my own Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe ≈øhe ≈øpake the truth, for ≈øhe never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to her Soul. Ju≈øt like Doctor <hi>Lopez</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> who being convented before the Privy Councel, for attempting to Poy≈øon Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> told their Honors, <hi>That be loved the Queen better than be loved Chri≈øt. Yea,</hi> (≈øaid a Noble Lord, <hi>thou telle≈øt the truth, for thou art a</hi> Jew, <hi>and love≈øt both a like.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Sir, I knew that this wicked Maid had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make away her Mi≈øtris, and that ≈øhe did it; but I was loth to di≈øcover, and now I mu≈øt ≈øuffer for her fault.</hi> I told her no, it was for her own; and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96502:39"/>≈øhe did not yet confe≈øs any thing to the purpo≈øe, all this I knew before, you mu≈øt tell me as to your own hand and Guilt in this Murder. <hi>None! None at all Sir,</hi> that is her an≈øwer.</p>
            <p>But Nur≈øe, did you not tell ≈øuch a Mini≈øter that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øited you in Goal, that you would con≈øider what he ≈øpoke unto you? at this ≈øhe changed countenance, paled and redded once and again, minced, aequivocat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and faltered in her expre≈ø≈øions; but taking her in all her Eva≈øions, ≈øhe could not deny ≈øhe had promi≈øed him; and had con≈øidered of it, <hi>yet knew no guilt by her ≈øelf worthy of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Getting no ground here, I askt her concerning the Gold, her Brother took her for his Child, ≈øhe told me ≈øhe never had any from him. Why then did you ≈øpeak to Ma≈øter <hi>W.</hi> to look after your Money, if you never had any, and be ≈øuch a Poor Woman?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir, I will without any di≈ø≈øimulation tell yon all the Truth. My Brother acquainted me that there was Ten Pound in a Pur≈øe hanging between the Vallance and the Wall of his Bed Chamber in</hi> Loo: <hi>Whereupon my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band got an Hor≈øe in</hi> Plymouth, <hi>Rode thither and brought it to me. So that I never had any of my Brother, but my Husband had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Nur≈øe, this may be as you ≈øay, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly there was more; but how have you di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed of it? She replied, <hi>It is put out for my Child.</hi> I told her this is a very horrid Theft, the healer was as bad in the ≈øight of God as the ≈øtealer; that without Re≈øtitution there was no Remi≈ø≈øion: That unle≈øs ≈øhe took ≈øome cour≈øe for its being re≈øtored, ≈øhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ≈øaved: That God would never ble≈øs it unto her Child: Yea, the very contrary, for it would be a ≈ønare and a cur≈øe unto her, and an occa≈øion of de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto her, otherwi≈øe, innocent Child.</p>
            <p>And recollecting all my former di≈øcour≈øes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96502:40"/>to her, I pre≈ø≈øed with all po≈ø≈øible earne≈øtne≈øs and importunity, not willfully to precipitate her ≈øelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell. That there were now but a few Sands in her Gla≈øs, a few breaths in her body, a few minutes in her time, that ≈øhe ≈øhould not play the Fool any longer; love the Devil, and hate God. The Devil had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready undone her, yet the Lord was willing to ≈øave her. He ≈øent me once again upon that errand, but if ≈øhe were re≈øolved to adhere unto her grand Enemy, and utterly for≈øake the Lord her be≈øt Friend, I was heartily ≈øorry for her, I fore≈øaw ≈øhe mu≈øt <hi>Burn in Hell Everla≈øtingly.</hi> That in the day of Judgment, I ≈øhould be a witne≈øs again≈øt her, and it would be a fearful thing, that God Almighty ≈øhould tell her; did not I ≈øend Mini≈øter upon Mini≈øter to Convert, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile and ≈øave thee? Did not this and that come unto thee, Woe and intreat thee with tears in their eyes, with fair and gentle, with terrible and amazing words to confe≈øs and give Glory to me, but thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt not?</p>
            <p>Ah! Nur≈øe! Nur≈øe! What will you ≈øay unto the Lord then? She wept; and I wept for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>But recovering my ≈øelf, Woman ≈øaid I, do not flatter thy ≈øelf with fal≈øe hopes of Life. For I fear thou keepe≈øt the Devils Coun≈øel upon that account. Thou mu≈øt die. All the world cannot ≈øave thee. Ere three hours be ≈øpent and gone, thou mu≈øt be led unto the Gallows, and thence into Eternity. Oh! Hell! Hell! Hell! Woman is a place and ≈øtate of un≈øpeakable, of un≈øufferable horror and torment: Yet, Flee! Flee! Flee from it! Or thou art undone for ever.</p>
            <p>I now Love, Pitty, Intreat, and Pray for thee<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> But if thou wilt be a Reprobate, a ca≈øt away, I take God to witne≈øs, I have done my duty, my utmo≈øt to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96502:40"/>≈øave thee, Lord, ≈øaid I, lifting up my Eyes and Hands to Heaven, I am free of the ruin of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Let her Blood, and Damnation lie upon her own Head!</p>
            <p>And Nur≈øe, It is a very fearful thing to fall into the bands of the living God. The God to whom thou art going, is a con≈øuming Fire. Ah! Who can abide his anger? Who can ≈øtand before his indignation? None will compa≈ø≈øionate thee at thy death. And in the day of Judgment, thou wilt be an abhorrency to all.</p>
            <p>All this wrought nothing upon her be≈øides tears: Still ≈øhe avows her innocency; and had I not had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtionable evidence of her guilt, po≈ø≈øibly I might have been per≈øwaded ≈øhe was accu≈øed and condemned unju≈øtly.</p>
            <p>After this I ≈øat down, and Mr. <hi>Collings,</hi> the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mini≈øter of <hi>Charles</hi> Church coming in, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoned with her for a long time, as al≈øo my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> But a Marble Quarry affords no Water, nor her ≈øtony Heart one penitential Tear. At length all their pains being u≈øele≈øs, ineffectual; and un≈øuccesful, we re≈øolved to try the Lord once more by Prayer, and ≈øee whether any mercy might be got out of Heaven for her.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> was our Mouth to God. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Per≈øons were upon their knees. Duty ended, I departed, and never ≈øpake more with her, till ≈øhe was upon the Ladder.</p>
            <p>ANd now ≈øhe is waited on to the Gallows.</p>
            <p>The Streets are crowded. The Major, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates, and under Sheriff can hardly pa≈øs for the throngs.</p>
            <p>The poor Maid is drawn on the Hurdle. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture ≈øhe lay in was on her left ≈øide, her Face in her
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96502:41"/>Bo≈øom, her Bible under her Arm, ≈øeeming like one dead, rather than alive.</p>
            <p>At length we are come, though ≈ølowly to the place of Execution. <hi>Plimouth</hi> was then naked of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the Town was ea≈øie to be taken, and the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes to be plundered, if an Enemy had been at hand to have done it. <hi>Cat downe,</hi> the <hi>Lambhey, Cittadel, Turn-Chappel,</hi> and <hi>Cat-Water</hi> are pre≈øt with multitudes. Some computed their number I'wenty thou≈øand. But Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who at lived in Wars, and ≈øeen great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore the mo≈øt competent Judges in this ca≈øe, e≈øtimated them at one half. I write within compa≈øs.</p>
            <p>The Maid being nailed to her Stake, and the Iron Hoop about her, and the Nur≈øe mounted upon the Ladder, ≈øhe de≈øires. that this Relator might now Pray with her.</p>
            <p>But it being thought requi≈øite that the e≈øtabli≈øhed Order of the Church ≈øhould be ob≈øerved, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers were fir≈øt Commanded. Which having been read Audably, and with great Devotion from the By-≈øtanders. The 51. <hi>P≈øalm</hi> according to the Girls reque≈øt was ≈øung: Who (it was very ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,) joyned with the People, ≈øinging al≈øo her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øhe being que≈øtioned about her offence owns every particular thereof, it having been propounded to her in particulars. Owneth that the Nur≈øe bad her put it in; Only denieth the Depo≈øition of <hi>Scannels</hi> Wife, profe≈ø≈øing that ≈øhe cannot remember it: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øeth her hearty and unfeigned ≈øorrow for her ≈øin, not only becau≈øe it had ruined her Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes and her ≈øelf; but principally, and e≈øpecially becau≈øe it was an high di≈øhonor to God, Father, Son, and Spirit, that it made her unworthy of his Favor and Ble≈ø≈øing; yet ≈øhe profe≈ø≈øed her Faith and Hope of Salvation, through
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96502:41"/>the alone Merits of the Lord Je≈øus, Into who≈øe hands ≈øhe now commended her ≈øelf; and de≈øired to forgive all the World, and that Bloody Woman the Nur≈øe, who had drawn her into de≈øtruction; and added, that ≈øhe ≈øubmitted patiently to her death, becau≈øe ≈øhe had de≈øerved it. And ≈øaid, it was her wi≈øh, that all others would take warning by her Example; and taking this Relator by the hand, <hi>Sir,</hi> ≈øaith ≈øhe, <hi>will you not pray with me? Did you not promi≈øe me yon would?</hi> And cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it with Tears, it was readily accorded.</p>
            <p>Silence being commanded, and every Per≈øon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, there was this following Prayer conceived, and poured before the Lord in her behalf.</p>
            <floatingText xml:lang="eng" type="prayer">
               <body>
                  <p>MO≈øt Holy Lord God! The Righteous Judg of the whole World! Ju≈øt in all thy Ways, and Holy in all Works! The great and terrible God! a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming Fire, and everla≈øting burnings! How can ≈øuch ≈øinful chaff, and ≈øtubble as we are ≈øtand before thee? We mu≈øt needs in a Moment be reduced unto A≈øhes, if thou ha≈øt not pitty on us. But ble≈ø≈øed be thy Name, thou art a God of wonderful Love and Mercies, Thou ha≈øt ≈øo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the World as to give thine only begotten Son to the death for us, that we believing in him ≈øhould not peri≈øh but have everla≈øting life.</p>
                  <p>We are greater Sinners than the Apo≈øtate Angels, and yet have greater Mercies afforded us, though they are better capacited to ≈øerve God than our ≈øelves, and never ≈øinned again≈øt thee but once, yet thou did≈øt utterly reject them, never gave≈øt a Chri≈øt to them, nor to die for them; whereas thou ha≈øt be≈øtowed him on us the mo≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Per≈øons, Sons and Daughters of ≈øinful Adam, who have never cea≈øed ≈øinning again≈øt thee.</p>
                  <p>We are all Sinners by Nature, and from our Youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. We were conceived in ≈øin, and born in iniquity. Our Infancy, our Youth, and riper years have been all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96502:42"/>spent in the drudgery of ≈øin. We have broken all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of our God in heart, thought, word, and deed; ≈øinned again≈øt the Law, and again≈øt the Go≈øpel; again≈øt all the means u≈øed by our God to reclaim, and to reform us. We have despi≈øed the be≈øt of Mercies, and de≈øerved the wor≈øt of Judgments, yea to be burnt up with unquenchable flames, as this poor, wretched Malefactor is now ready to be with tho≈øe that are temporal. But hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thou ha≈øt spared and reprieved us, and given us space for Repentance, and waite≈øt to be gracious to us, and bidde≈øt us, ≈øeek thee O our God, while≈øt thou maye≈øt be found, and call upon thee while≈øt thou art near, it for≈øake our ungodline≈øs, and to forego all our wickedne≈øs, and thou woulde≈øt abundantly pardon; yea thou art ≈øo gracious, as to bid and incourage us to Pray for others, with promi≈øes of Audience and Acceptance.</p>
                  <p>This emboldens us to make our addre≈ø≈øes to thee for this poor <hi>condemned Creature,</hi> ready to be executed. We confe≈øs for her, and ≈øhe doth acknowledg for her ≈øelf, Lord! her great and grievous offences, that ≈øhe hath been a Rebel again≈øt thee all her days, lived in ≈øin, neglected duty, neglected getting the ≈øaving knowledg of God, and acquaintance with thee; that ≈øhe hath not hearkened to the voice of God speaking from his holy Word unto her; but li≈øtned readily unto the Temptations and Sugge≈øtion of the Devil, a Murderer from the beginning, and by who≈øe enticements ≈øhe hath embrewed her hands in Blood, in the guilt of innocent Blood of her Relation and Superiors, which crys to Heaven for vengeance again≈øt her. Lord! ≈øhe cannot ≈øtand before the Ju≈øtice of Men. Ah! how unable is ≈øhe to ≈øub≈øi≈øt at the Bar of God? Man hath ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemned her, and the Lord might ju≈øtly damn her, and that to all Eternity. The wages of her ≈øin is death, death Temporal, and Eternal.</p>
                  <p>But Lord! though ≈øhe is mi≈øerable, thou art merciful; though ≈øhe is full of ≈øins, thou art full of pardons; though
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96502:42"/>≈øhe is helple≈øs in her ≈øelf, yet in thee Lord, is ≈øhe not hopele≈øs. Ble≈ø≈øed be God that hath opened a Door of hope for her in the Re≈øurrection of Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who was delivered to the death for her ≈øins, and ro≈øe again from the dead, that ≈øhe might be ju≈øtified. Thy Free guift in Chri≈øt Je≈øus is Eternal Life, Oh! How ≈øweet is thy mercy?</p>
                  <p>Suffer us, Ble≈ø≈øed Father! in all humility to plead with thee in her behalf, Oh, That thou woulde≈øt be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to her! she is thy Creature, the work of thine hands, do not de≈øtroy her! She is the purcha≈øe of thy Sons blood, Oh, Let him not loo≈øe her! Chri≈øt died for her, Oh, Let him not die in vain for her! Therefore ≈øave her! Her ≈øins are many, but thy mercies are infinitely more, her ≈øins are Bloody, Crim≈øon, Scarlet, and crying ≈øins. but the blood of Je≈øus clean≈øeth from all ≈øins. Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed by her cryeth down Vengeance on her. But yet, dear Lord! Hear! Oh hear the lowder outcries of thy Sons blood for her! She is, if ever any, an object wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of pitty, not from any worth in her, but becau≈øe of her mi≈øery. If God do not help her, who will? Who can? Men and Angels cannot ≈øave her, but Je≈øus Chri≈øt can. He is able. And Be≈ø≈øed be thy name, ≈øweet Je≈øu! Thou art willing al≈øo even to the wor≈øt and utmo≈øt to ≈øave.</p>
                  <p>Thou art an Almighty, and All ≈øufficient Saviour, thine arm is not ≈øhortened, thy Grace is not exhau≈øted. Oh, Magnifie thy Grace now, even now upon her! Thou ha≈øt ≈øaid, that the weary, the heavy laden ≈øhould come unto thee, and thou woulde≈øt give them re≈øt: And that ≈øuch as come unto thee, though the greate≈øt ≈øinners, thou woulde≈øt not ca≈øt out 'Tis late indeed that ≈øhe comes unto thee, but not too late. Truth Lord! Late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ≈øeldom true, but yet true Repentance is never too late. Bitter late than never.</p>
                  <p>Thou ha≈øt given us one in≈øtance, one example of the Thief on the Cro≈øs ≈øaved at the Eleventh, at the la≈øt hour ≈øave one, 'tis but one, that we ≈øhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96502:43"/>and yet one, that we. ≈øhould not de≈øpair; Oh Lord, ≈øhe will not de≈øpair of thy mercy, that were a greater ≈øin than all the re≈øt that ≈øhe hath committed. Now Lord, though late ≈øhe comes unto thee, ≈øhe throws her ≈øelf at thy Feet, and we thy poor Servants come unto thee, and pro≈øtrate our ≈øelves at thy fleet for her: Oh! Do not ca≈øt her out of thy ≈øight! Oh! Let her not be Damned, but ≈øaved! This is a true and faithful ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, worthy of all acceptation, mo≈øt worthy of hers, and ≈øhe accepts of it, and re≈øts upon it, and tru≈øts unto it, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt came into the World to ≈øave ≈øinners, <hi>Of whom ≈øhe is chief,</hi> Thou art willing that all ≈øhould be ≈øaved: Therefore thou art willing ≈øhe ≈øhould be ≈øav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed al≈øo. Thou ha≈øt put the≈øe words into her mouth, and into our mouths for her. <hi>That if Je≈øus Chri≈øt, hath not merits enough to ≈øave her, ≈øhe, and we al≈øo will be contented that ≈øhe ≈øhould be Damned for, ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Ble≈ø≈øed be our God! The merits of our Saviour are Infinite, Oh! Lord, make application of them unto her poor Soul. Oh! Take away for Chri≈øts ≈øake all her ≈øins! Blot out her iniquities at a Cloud, and her Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øions as a thick Cloud, Though her ≈øins have abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto her Condemnation, yet let thy grace much more, infinitely more abound unto her ju≈øtification. Enter not into judgment with her, Oh Lord! Deliver her from blood guiltine≈øs, Oh God, thou God of her salvation! And her Tongue, and our mouths ≈øhall ≈øing aloud of Chri≈øts Righteou≈øne≈øs and of thy Faithfulne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Oh, take away what≈øoever may hinder the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy Love, favor, and salvation unto her! Purge ≈øin out of her!

            <p>Prayer being ended, I lifted up my hands over her, and ≈øaid, <hi>Anne,</hi> the Lord ble≈øs thee, and keep thee! The Lord make his Face to ≈øhine upon thee, and be gracious to thee! The Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon thee, and give thee Peace! And if thy Repentance be true, and thy peace made with God, and our Prayers heard, as I hope they all are, death wont be terrible unto thee. Now Farewel Life, welcome Death. God will ≈øend his Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in a Fiery Chariot to Convey thy Soul into Heaven.</p>
            <p>THis poor wretch weeping, and wringing me by the hand, <hi>Sir,</hi> ≈øaith ≈øhe, <hi>I am never able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite you for all your labor of love, care and pains about the Salvation of my pretious Soul; but the Lord. will, I hope.

            </p>
            <p>And as I was departing from her, ≈øhe helpake me, <hi>Sir, pray intreat for me, that I may not be put to too much torture.</hi> I an≈øwered her in broken words and tears (for few there refrained.) That I would do my utmo≈øt endeavor to prevent it: And turning my ≈øelf to the Gentlemen in Authority. Gentlemen, the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> temper abhors Cruelty, ≈øhow ≈øame Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to this poor Creature. I need not intreat it, there was ≈øuch a Clowd of grief ≈øitting upon all their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96502:45"/>Faces, and ≈øo much tenderne≈øs and companion, that they would have done their utmo≈øt to have hindred it.</p>
            <p>Two‚Äîwent to the Maid, and asked her what Faith and what Repentance were. And one of them proceeded to in≈øtruct her in the nature of Faith, that it was to take Chri≈øt as Lord and King, and to ≈øubmit unto all his Laws, to be Governed by them, and in particular to this of ≈øuffering the puni≈øhment inflicted on her for her ≈øin.</p>
            <p>At which putting them off with my Hand, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen; do not trouble her, 'tis un≈øea≈øonable now to Catechize her in Doctrinals; ≈øhe ≈øtands in need of ≈øome Soveraign Cordials to revive and ≈øupport her drooping Spirit in the≈øe her la≈øt Agonies with death, and conflicts with the Devil.</p>
            <p>And Addre≈ø≈øing my ≈øelf once again unto her, <hi>Anne</hi> ≈øaid I, fear not, but ca≈øt thy ≈øelf upon the everla≈øting mercies of God in the blood of Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved.

Lord Je≈øu, thou Son of <hi>David</hi> have mercy upon me! Oh, Thou Lamb of God receive my Soul!</p>
            <p>I left her, expecting no an≈øwer. The Rope is now drawn clo≈øe unto her Neck, and the Hangman would have ≈øet Fire unto the Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ze before ≈øhe was ≈øtrangled but ≈øome more charitable and tender-hearted, cryed to him to take away the Block from under her Feet; which having done, ≈øhe ≈øoon fell down, and expired in a Trice.</p>
            <p>And it was ob≈øervable, that all the skill and diligence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96502:45"/>of the Executioner and his A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, could not make either Powder, Wood, or Fewel to take fire; till ≈øhe had been dead a Quarter of an hour; as al≈øo, that as ≈øoon as the fire was kindled, the Wind which blew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the back of the Nur≈øe, immediately ≈øhifted, and drove the ≈ømoke full in her Face; as if God had ≈øpoken to her, The Smoke of my Fury, and Flames of my Fiery Vengeance are now Riding upon the Wings of the Wind towards thee.</p>
            <p>And now for Two hours, the Nur≈øe feeds her eyes, and fea≈øts her thoughts with the ≈øad ≈øpectacle of this poor Maids burning.</p>
            <p>The flames being well allayed, ≈øeveral Mini≈øters, and worthy Gentlemen indeavor yet the Repentance, Conver≈øion, and Saving of her Soul. But All ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds as formerly. She denies her guilt; pleads her Innocency, accu≈øeth Judg, Jury, Witne≈ø≈øes, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all of her Murther; that ≈øhe is Murthered, that they take away her Life unju≈øtly: Nay, that they kill too; ≈øhe is with Child, expects to be delivered about Mid≈øummer. What will you Murther one that is unborn? And a great deal more of the like ≈øtuff.</p>
            <p>That ≈øhe was not with Child we heard evidenced upon Oath at her condemnation. And a skilful Hand-Woman, ≈øearching her but a night before her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could never di≈øcover any ≈øuch thing.</p>
            <p>Mo≈øt probable the true ground of all her denials, was a fooli≈øh hope of Life; the Hangman as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly noi≈øed, having promi≈øed never to execute her. Whatever familiarities had pa≈øt between them Two in Jail, I know not. This is certain, the Hangman brought the under Sheriff to terms ju≈øt as they were leaving <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and going to the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the Girl being di≈øpatched, he ran away with the Halter under the Clifts; and when he was brought back, lay a≈øleep at the Foot of the Gallows,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96502:46"/>or at lea≈øt pretended ≈øleep, and ≈øo de≈øerted Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides another Accident intervened, which put a ≈øtop for a time, and had it not been prudently and pre≈øently compo≈øed upon the place, would have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ≈øu≈øpended, for that day at lea≈øt, her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>All the≈øe Circum≈øtances jumping in one upon the other, contributed to the ≈øtrengthening of her Heart in the fal≈øe hopes of Life. For what ≈øhe would have, it was an ea≈øie matter to per≈øwade her to believe and hope.</p>
            <p>But at length ≈øhe hath worn out all patience both of God, and Man. And the Halter is fa≈øtened to the Gibber, and put about her Neck. Now Mini≈øters ply their work with her, becau≈øe ≈øhe is upon the brink of De≈øtruction, and in view of Hell.</p>
            <p>No ≈øin ≈øhe acknowledged, no guilt as to the Fact for which ≈øhe is condemned. Indeed ≈øhe confe≈ø≈øeth, <hi>She had been a Swearer, Lier, and Sabbath breaker,</hi> but none others trouble her. As to Money that her Brother ≈øtole, and was in hers, or her Husbands hands, ≈øhe now chargeth upon a dead Per≈øon, having wronged her in her life, the mu≈øt mi≈øchief her at her death too. No Bond, nor Bill can ≈øhe produce, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the Decea≈øed's hand can ≈øhe ≈øhow for her having received it; yet doth ≈øhe charge Mr. <hi>W.</hi> to look that it be re≈øtored unto the right Owner.</p>
            <p>Mini≈øters however lament her deplorable condition, e≈øpecially ≈øince ju≈øt as ≈øhe is going out of the World, ≈øhe cryes, <hi>Judg and Revenge my cau≈øe, O Lord!</hi> Which made this Relator tell her, He now ≈øaw, what he formerly feared, <hi>viz.</hi> That God was departed from her, that the Devil was already in her heart, for he ≈øat upon her tongue, that troops of Devils were upon the Ladder by her, all gaping for her; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96502:46"/>in a few moments, they would have her wretched Soul into Hell with them; and then, and there ≈øhe would be ≈øoon ≈øen≈øible of her madne≈øs in dying with a Lye in her Mouth, and confe≈øs, and mourn for her folly and madne≈øs in rejecting Heaven and Salvation, but it would be too late, and to no purpo≈øe: For her condition, whatever it might be here, would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be there unalterable, and irrever≈øible.</p>
            <p>That ≈øhe was going into a Lake of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone there to be tormented for ever and ever; and when ≈øhe was in the mid≈øt of tho≈øe Eternal torments, ≈øhe would remember that I had told her of it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>P≈øalm</hi> was called, and part of the Twenty fifth ≈øung. Never did I ≈øee but one in that heavy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whil≈øt the people ≈øing, ≈øhe cries and weeps bitterly, the very terrors of death are upon her, ≈øhe cries as if her Heart would break. Indeed her Soul was overwhelmed with unmea≈øurable horrors and fears; ≈øhe had no mind to die, nor could ≈øhe be vouch≈øafed Life. What hopes could ≈øhe have in her departure, who never laid any ≈øollid ba≈øis for good hopes during life?</p>
            <p>The <hi>P≈øalm</hi> is now sung out, and yet is ≈øhe ≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to confe≈øs, but it is as good ≈øpeak to the ≈øtones, or to the Deaf Adder, that ≈øtops his ear, ≈øhe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be charmed, let the Charmers Charm never ≈øo wi≈øely.</p>
            <p>At la≈øt being demanded whether ≈øhe would have any Prayers, or any Per≈øon Pray for her, ≈øhe ≈øaid yes, and pointed to this Relator, de≈øiring him to perform that Office for her: Who replied, that he was mo≈øt willing to ≈øerve and ≈øave her Soul: But in as much as ≈øhe made no Confe≈ø≈øion of her Crying ≈øins of Murther, and of her Theft and Uncleanne≈øs, and other Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies whereof me knew her ≈øelt Guilty, he dur≈øt not take the name of God in vain tor her ≈øake; Be≈øides
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96502:47"/>he ≈øhould but tempt God to ask a pardon for her, Who re≈øolved never to take it upon Gods Terms.</p>
            <p>In ≈øhort, if ≈øhe would be yet ingenious, and give Glory to God by adoring his Ju≈øtice, and ≈øhameing her ≈øelf, and renouncing her ≈øin and the Devil, there Was no per≈øon more willing to pray with her, and pray for her than him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>To which ≈øhe making no reply, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> the Mini≈øter conceived a pithy and pertinent Prayer, lamenting the depravedne≈øs of our Nature, the horriblene≈øs of Gods wrath, the po≈ø≈øibility of Salvation refu≈øed by de≈øperate ≈øinners, and as we feared in particular by this Malefactor his dear Si≈øter now ready to be turned over. He petitioned that if it were not yet too late, that God would give her Repentance, and break her ≈øtony heart, and cau≈øe her to glorifie him at the la≈øt by an ingenious and full Confe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>Prayer being ended, ≈øhe is once again asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhe would confe≈øs. But being ob≈øtinate in her refu≈øals, ≈øhe prayed for her ≈øelf in the words of the lords Prayer, ≈øaid the Creed; and being yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to Remember the merciful nature of God, who would ≈øave her, as we yet hoped, provided ≈øhe would come unto his Terms of Confe≈ø≈øion and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>She tells us. <hi>She cannot confe≈øs that whereof is not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being asked whether ≈øhe could die in Charity with her Witne≈ø≈øes and Accu≈øers. She ≈øaid, <hi>I forgive all the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a while after, without any vi≈øible tokens of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Grace, or Devotion, without any ob≈øervable preparedne≈øs or willingne≈øs for death, by any of tho≈øe many Divines that had painfully dealt with her, or Chri≈øtians that beheld her, ≈øhe was turned
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96502:47"/>off the Ladder, and went into that other World. She went out like the Snuff of a Candle, leaving a ≈øtench behind her.</p>
            <p>And if it be asked, what is become of her Soul?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, the Que≈øtion is idle, needle≈øs, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious, and unprofitable, 'tis not for ≈øaucy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, poor crawling Earth-worms, (≈øuch at our ≈øelves are) to pry into the deep ≈øecrets of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Coun≈øels, nor to peep into the ≈øacred Ark of his bottomle≈øs decrees. The≈øe in≈øcrutable purpo≈øes of God by rea≈øon of their inexplicable difficulties will amaze and puzle us; nor can we ever po≈ø≈øibly attain unto any infallible certainty or ≈øatisfaction concerning her. I know the ab≈øolute and uncontroulable Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Divine Grace and mercies, and that God can come in, if he plea≈øe, between the Bridge and Water, the Cup and the Lip. But who can inform, or a≈ø≈øure me that God did ≈øo to her? She is gone unto her Judge, hath undergone her Doom; and if ≈øhe be ≈øaved, it is a Thou≈øand mercies unto the World, that the World neither doth, nor can know it.</p>
            <p>But did ≈øhe not prote≈øt her Innocency to the very la≈øt.</p>
            <p>I know ≈øhe did, and is ≈øhe Innocent becau≈øe ≈øhe ≈øaid ≈øo? Dying per≈øons are indeed to be credited: But then they mu≈øt be per≈øons of credit and ≈øerious; and if Condemned Malefactors, ≈øuch as are mo≈øt Eminent and exemplary for their Repentance. Can any one Man or Woman living, that Conver≈øt with her from fir≈øt to la≈øt, from her Impri≈øonment to her Execution, avow upon her knowledge, that ≈øhe ≈øaw ≈øo much as one poor token of a broken heart, of a ≈øincere Penitent in her? Produce it, and it ≈øhall be Thankfully accepted.</p>
            <p>Had ≈øhe been Innocent, ≈øhe could not have been ≈øo much concerned for life as ≈øhe was? I told her in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96502:48"/>
               <hi>'Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Exon,</hi> and ≈øhe was told the ≈øame by a Reverend Divine, that Innocency was a Wall of Bra≈øs, it would carry a Per≈øon above the fear of Death, make her to outbrave Death; ≈øhe could go trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly into the pre≈øence of the Eternal Judg, and ble≈øs him that ≈øhe was condemned unju≈øtly.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, her Innocence as to this Fact, would have ingaged her to a more curious and exact ≈øcrutiny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her life pa≈øt, to have found out the true cau≈øe of Gods anger in ≈øhortning her days, and to a mo≈øt holy life, and religious preparation of her Soul for death, during the whole time of her impri≈øonment. None of which ≈øhe had done; unle≈øs loo≈øene≈øs, prophanene≈øs, and uncleanne≈øs mu≈øt be expounded, and taken for it.</p>
            <p>Finally, I lookt upon her as a de≈øperate and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne wretch, and told her it was no new thing to find her ≈øuch. 'Tis no new thing tor the wor≈øt of ≈øinners to be de≈øperate. Were not <hi>Cain, Saul, Abimelech, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> de≈øperate? This Relator heard a man Condemned to be Hanged, utter upon the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the≈øe words.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I value not my life of a Ru≈øh, I fear not death; and without any more Ceremonies or ado, (and Soldiers are none of the mo≈øt Religious.) He willfully leapt off of the Ladder at <hi>Crimble-pa≈ø≈øage:</hi> Where had not others ≈øhown his body more mercy than he did hi own Soul, he might have peri≈øht ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øtingly.</p>
            <p>I know not whether ≈øhe had as much Courage. Sure I am, Death never ≈øtruck unto her Spirits; till the <hi>P≈øalm</hi> was a Singing, and it was a doleful Tune unto her. Her heart was then up in her mouth. If it were not broke with the ≈øence of ≈øin, and near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Divine wrath, it was with the very hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of death. Others Sang, ≈øhe did but howl and yell. Methought the expre≈ø≈øions of her grief, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96502:48"/>vehemency of her pa≈ø≈øions, rai≈øed ≈øtrange re≈øentments and compa≈ø≈øions in the Spectators.</p>
            <p>One, and but one have I known in her condition, a big and tall Fellow, that upon the ≈øcore of his ≈øtrength, could have affrighted the King of Terrors: Yet after Sentence (and for Burglary was he Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced unto death,) his heart failed him, his Spirits ≈øunk, his Soul died within him: All his Language, and that too in groans and Floods of Tears, with blubbered Cheeks and wringed hands, was: <hi>I ≈øhall die! I ≈øhall die! I ≈øhall die! I ≈øhall die! Woe is me! I ≈øhall die! I ≈øhall die!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though I came to him into the Jail, took him by the hand, intreated him upon my knees, not to be ≈øo much concerned for the lo≈øs of his Natural Life: But to look after another, a better Life, after the life of his mi≈øerable Soul; Yet no Arguments, no motives could prevail upon him. He was Deaf in that ear. A ≈øtone might have heard and an≈øwered, but this wretch would give none other an≈øwer, than, <hi>I ≈øhall die! I ≈øhall die! Woe is me! I ≈øhall die! I ≈øhall die!</hi> The terrors of death, like an opiate Medicine, had quite ≈øtupified him, that he could not li≈øten unto the be≈øt Coun≈øels for his Souls welfare.</p>
            <p>But what and if this vile woman had been Guilty of ≈øome other Capital Crimes? I know of the dead rue be≈øt mu≈øt be ≈øpoken; but then tho≈øe dead per≈øons ≈øhould not be Impenitent Criminals.</p>
            <p>It is no plea≈øure to me, no plea≈øing task to Rake in Dunghils. Would to God all Vices were Buried together with hers, though under the Gibbet! It were no difficult matter, nay a man might with a wet Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, prove her Guilty of ≈øoul and frequent Adulteries, of Debauching Young per≈øons, of pro≈øtituting her ≈øelf in Pri≈øon, are the≈øe no Capital offences? Let them not be! What meant ≈øhe by tho≈øe words unto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96502:49"/>the Girl, that to her knowledg a little Poy≈øon in Cream had made one away in le≈øs time than you could go from her Matters Hou≈øe to the Gate.</p>
            <p>I am apt to think that ≈øhe would not confe≈øs this Murder le≈øt ≈øome other might out al≈øo. There was a ≈øhrewed <hi>Item</hi> in her <hi>Exon</hi> acknowledgment, That ≈øhe knew ≈øhe ≈øhould be damned, though not for this Crime.</p>
            <p>It brings to my remembrance a Story which I had from Mr. <hi>B. Cl.</hi> a very holy Man of God, a Reverend Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel, (who if yet in the Land of the living, is one of the mo≈øt Ancient Laborers in the Lords Vineyard in this We≈øtern Dioce≈øs,) that in his younger days when he was Mini≈øter of <hi>Petrocks</hi> by the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> he was ≈øent to Vi≈øit and Pray with a dying Man, under very much trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience.</p>
            <p>His ca≈øe was this, Sir, ≈øaid he unto the Mini≈øter, about Seven months ≈øince, as I was walking to <hi>Bu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> I met a Camerade of mine, who had gone to Sea about a fortnight ≈øince, and taking him by the hand, wondring at his arrival, I ≈øaid, VVhat cheat Mate? What makes thee return ≈øo ≈øoon, and look ≈øo Pale? I am dead quoth this <hi>Spectrum.</hi> Dead Man, and yet walk, and talk? Yes, ≈øaith he, I am dead. I was took ≈øick ≈øhortly upon my going to Sea; and died this day, and about an hour ≈øince, ≈øo many Leagues off, was I thrown overboard.</p>
            <p>Now I de≈øire thee to go home, and tell my Wi≈øe of it, and to open my Coffer, and ≈øhow her my Will, and ≈øee my Legacies paid; which having promi≈øed to do for him, at parting he added, <hi>And at for that bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs between thee and me, that thou well wote≈øt off, I charge thee, that thou never speak of it to any Man living, for if thou do≈øt, I will in that very moment tear thee in a thou≈øand pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96502:49"/>
            <p>Now Sir, this lies heavy, heavy upon my Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Fain would I declare it, It is upon my Tongue, but I cannot. And why can you not? Oh Sir, do not you ≈øee him? Do not you ≈øee him? Look how terrible he is! There he is ju≈øt again≈øt me. Oh! how doth he threaten me? I would tell you, but I dare not, And whatever arguments this Reverend Per≈øonage could u≈øe unto the ≈øick Man, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring him to a Confe≈ø≈øion; but he pines away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his terrors, and horrors; till at la≈øt not being able to ≈øub≈øi≈øt any longer by rea≈øon of them, he died.</p>
            <p>Whether there be any parallel between the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Man, and Woman, I leave it unto my Readers judgment.</p>
            <p>The poor Girl, at her Death, at the very point of Death charged her with it. This <hi>Philip Cary</hi> her ≈øelf confe≈ø≈øed before the Major of <hi>Plymouth</hi> at her Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the very day before her Execution to this Relator, that ≈øhe knew of it. And is ≈øhe Innocent? We have rea≈øon to believe the confe≈ø≈øion of a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, before the denial of a ≈øtubborn, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent VVoman.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, ≈øhe had a very fair trial before the Judg. There were no le≈øs than Nineteen VVitne≈ø≈øes that gave in their Evidence to his Lord≈øhip, and the Grand Jury upon Oath again≈øt her. Yet ≈øhe ≈øaith, Not guilty: Yea, and takes it to her death, that ≈øhe is Innocent, knew nothing of Poy≈øon.</p>
            <p>But what if all this be nothing but Lyes, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øture? VVhat if evidence appears again≈øt her after death, and that ≈øhe did both know of it, and buy the Poy≈øon al≈øo?</p>
            <p>Reader I will not amu≈øe thee, call thine Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what follows, and thou wilt be in ≈øo me mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure ≈øatisfied.</p>

It was an excellent Order of our Church, full of religious Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that tho≈øe who Married, ≈øhould on their wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day receive the Sacrament: Teaching us this Le≈ø≈øon, that none ≈øhould enter upon Family charges, before they did well under≈øtand the nature of Family duties. Ah! how much is this neglected? Per≈øons get into a married life, and yet them Families, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Children before they have any skill to govern them≈øelves, and neither skill nor will to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern s;uch as are under them.</p>
               <p>This is the true Source of all our mi≈øchiefs, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary and Root of our abounding Prophanene≈øs; and till there be a Reformation here in our re≈øpective Families, in Ma≈øters, and Parents, I ≈øhall de≈øpair of ever meeting with it among Children, or Servants. If Children prove unnatural, and Servants ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, Why did you not teach them better? If you are ignorant of your duties, do not complain that they neglect theirs. If Poy≈øon and Murder come into a Family, it was becau≈øe the fear of God was not there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>My dear Plimouthians,</hi> Give good Examples to tho≈øe that are under you. They are led more by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples than Precepts. They do not write after the be≈øt Copies, but tho≈øe that are neare≈øt hand. Oh! walk before God, before your Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in a perfect way. Read and Meditate upon the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96502:55"/>101. <hi>P≈øalm.</hi> There is a divine Platform of your whole duty. What Children learn from their Parents, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from their Ma≈øters, that do they in≈øtil and teach al≈øo unto their Children and Servants.</p>
               <p>The happine≈øs or wretchedne≈øs, the weal and woe of the next age depends upon the Education, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this. Make not po≈øterity mi≈øerable, nor your own Fle≈øh and Blood, your deare≈øt parts, your chiefe≈øt Goods to cur≈øe you when you are dead and gone, for your cockering and indulgence to them.</p>
               <p>Live all the Sermons you hear, and be an Epi≈øtle of commendation of your Mini≈øters to your Children, Servants, Families, and the whole World. Let none under your roofs have occa≈øion to behold your mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages. They are natural Apes, imitating what is had, not what is good. Keep your ≈øelves from all ≈øin, and keep the ≈øight of ≈øin from all that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. If Children and Servants in≈øtead of Praying, hear Swearing and Cur≈øing, in≈øtead of the Bible and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techi≈øms, bloody Oaths and Bla≈øpheming, in≈øtead of ≈øeeing Holine≈øs, and the ≈øhining beauties of Godline≈øs, ≈øhall be the Spectators of their Parents wickedne≈øs and uncleanne≈øs, Athei≈øm and Irreligion; Mark it, Sirs, Mark what I tell you, without Miracles of mercy, you, and your Children, and your Servants, and your Hou≈øes ≈øhall be undone Eternally. <hi>The cur≈øe of the Lord is it to the Hou≈øe of the Wicked, but he ble≈ø≈øeth the Habitation of the Ju≈øt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. My dear Town≈ømen, Perform Family duties, let them not grow out of u≈øe and fa≈øhion. Whatever others do, yet do you and your Families ≈øerve the Lord. Give God a Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer and Thank≈øgiving. <hi>He hath throatned to pour out his wrath upon the Families that call not upon his Name.</hi> Jer. 10. <hi>ult.</hi> Prayerle≈øs Families, are Pagani≈øh Families, and Heathen Families are loathed by God.</p>

               <p>Read the Scriptures daily in your Hou≈øes, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize and In≈øtruct in the doctrinals of Religion the Youth within your Gates. Repeat, and frequently di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe with them about the Word of God read, and preached. Sanctifie the Lords day. Sing <hi>P≈øalms,</hi> and the high-≈øounding Prai≈øes of God in your dwellings. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Proficiency of your Children, and Servants in the grace and knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt. Give due and ≈øea≈øonable reprehen≈øion and correction, and ≈øpare not the Rod, unle≈øs you will ≈øpoil the Child. Comfort and incourage them in well-doing<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Pre≈øs them to private duties, and give them time for Clo≈øet-prayer; and do you endeavor to bring them to the publick Wor≈øhip and Ordinances, e≈øpecially to the Sacraments.

               <p n="4">4. Con≈øider with your ≈øelves that you have the charge of Souls, there is a great tru≈øt committed from Heaven unto Governours of Families. The Lord Trea≈øurer of the Kingdom hath no ≈øuch Jewels, nor Trea≈øure in the Exchequer, as you have in your Hou≈øes. God hath made you the Guardians and Tru≈øtees of pretious Souls, and as ≈øure as you live, ≈øhall you be re≈øpon≈øible for them unto God. Do your utmo≈øt that none mi≈øcarry under your hands. Prefer the concerns of their Souls to tho≈øe of your Bodies, and be at as much care and pains that they may live in Heaven, as you and yours to live on Earth. You are their be≈øt and ≈øure≈øt Friends, if fa≈øt and faithful Friends unto their Souls. To ruin a Soul is the Trick and Work of Devils, it is an irreparable lo≈øs, an everla≈øting evil. Lo≈øt Goods may be recovered, but if a Soul be once damned, either by your ≈øins of omi≈ø≈øion or commi≈ø≈øion, it can never be recovered more. The Lord deliver you from the Guilt of Soul-Murder.</p>

               <p n="5">5. When you di≈øpo≈øe your Children abroad in the World, get them into Religious Families, that they may drive a thriving trade Heaven-ward, and obtain the Inheritance of Gods Saints, his pretious promi≈øes. It is not Riches, nor Honors, nor great dealings in the VVorld; but Godline≈øs that hath the promi≈øes of this life, and of that which is to come.</p>

Con≈øider, that it is ju≈øt with God, they ≈øhould be In≈øtruments of your de≈øtruction, when your neglect of their Religious Education, is a real cau≈øe of their Trangre≈ø≈øion.
